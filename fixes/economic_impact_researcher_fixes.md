# Economic Impact Researcher Script Fixes

This document outlines the issues encountered and fixes applied to the `examples/economic_impact_researcher.py` script, which is used to research and generate reports on the economic impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.

## 1. ServicesContainer Import Error

### Problem
The script was failing with the following import error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Services' from 'core.services'
```

### Root Cause
The script was attempting to import a non-existent class `Services` from the `core.services` module. The correct class is named `ServicesContainer`.

### Fix
Changed the import statement from:
```python
from core.services import get_services, reset_services, ServicesContainer as Services
```

To:
```python
from core.services import get_services, reset_services, ServicesContainer
```

And updated the type annotation in the `register_required_planner_handlers` function from:
```python
def register_required_planner_handlers(services: Services) -> None:
```

To:
```python
def register_required_planner_handlers(services: ServicesContainer) -> None:
```

## 2. HandlerRegistry Attribute Access Issue

### Problem
After fixing the import issue, the script failed with an attribute error:
```
AttributeError: 'HandlerRegistry' object has no attribute 'handlers'. Did you mean: '_handlers'?
```

### Root Cause
The script was trying to access a non-existent public attribute `handlers` on the `HandlerRegistry` class. The actual attribute is named `_handlers` (with an underscore prefix), indicating it's a private implementation detail.

### Fix
Initially changed the code from:
```python
logger.info(f"Registered handlers: {list(handler_registry.handlers.keys())}")
```

To (temporary fix):
```python
logger.info(f"Registered handlers: {list(handler_registry._handlers.keys())}")
```

Upon further investigation, we discovered that the `HandlerRegistry` class already provides a public method `list_handlers()` that returns a list of all registered handler names. We improved the fix to:

```python
logger.info(f"Registered handlers: {handler_registry.list_handlers()}")
```

This approach follows best practices by using the public API rather than accessing private implementation details.

## 3. Enhanced Error Handling for LLM API Calls

### Problem
The script was failing silently or with cryptic error messages when there were issues with the OpenAI API key or when the API call was interrupted.

### Root Cause
The script lacked proper error handling for API-related issues, and did not check for the presence of the required environment variables.

### Fix
Added robust error handling:

1. Added API key validation:
```python
# Check for API key
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    logger.error("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set. Please set it and try again.")
    print("\n" + "*" * 80)
    print("ERROR: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set.")
    print("Please set it with: export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'")
    print("*" * 80 + "\n")
    return None
```

2. Added specific exception handling for API calls:
```python
try:
    results = engine.run()
    logger.info(f"Workflow execution completed with results: {results}")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    logger.warning("Workflow execution was interrupted by user (KeyboardInterrupt)")
    print("\n" + "*" * 80)
    print("Workflow execution was interrupted. This may be due to a slow API response.")
    print("If using OpenAI, check your API key and quota.")
    print("*" * 80 + "\n")
    results = None
except Exception as run_error:
    logger.error(f"Error during workflow execution: {str(run_error)}", exc_info=True)
    results = None
```

3. Added more detailed logging throughout the script to aid in debugging:
```python
logger.info("Services initialized successfully")
logger.info("All standard registrations ensured")
logger.info("Planner handlers registered successfully")
logger.info("Initial task added to workflow")
logger.info("Workflow visualization created")
logger.info("Creating workflow engine")
logger.info("Running workflow engine")
```

## 4. Improved Error Logging

### Problem
The script's error logging was minimal, making it difficult to diagnose issues.

### Root Cause
The script used basic error logging with minimal context.

### Fix
Enhanced the error logging to include full traceback information:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    logger.error("Full traceback:", exc_info=True)
    return None
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Use Consistent Naming**: Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase to prevent confusion.

2. **Respect Encapsulation**: Use public methods and properties instead of accessing private attributes directly.

3. **Robust Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling, especially for external services like API calls.

4. **Clear User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages to users when things go wrong, including actionable steps to resolve issues.

5. **Verification Before Runtime**: Check for required environment variables and configurations before attempting operations that depend on them.

6. **Detailed Logging**: Add detailed logging throughout the code to aid in debugging and understanding the execution flow.
