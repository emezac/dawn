# Fix for get_available_capabilities Tool

This document outlines the issues encountered with the `get_available_capabilities_tool` function in the `economic_impact_researcher.py` script and the fixes applied.

## Problem

The script was failing with an error when running the `get_available_capabilities_tool` function, which is an essential tool for the Chat Planner to understand what tools and handlers are available in the system. The error message indicated that the function was trying to use methods that don't exist in the related classes.

## Root Causes

There were two main issues:

1. The function was trying to call `get_all_handlers()` on the `HandlerRegistry` class, but this method doesn't exist in the `HandlerRegistry` implementation.

2. The function was trying to call `get_all_tools()` on the `ToolRegistry` class, but this method doesn't exist in the `ToolRegistry` implementation.

## Fixes

### 1. Fix for HandlerRegistry access

Changed from:
```python
# Get registered handlers and their names
handlers = handler_registry.get_all_handlers()
handler_names = list(handlers.keys())
```

To:
```python
# Get registered handlers and their names
handler_names = handler_registry.list_handlers()
```

The `HandlerRegistry` class provides a `list_handlers()` method that returns a list of all registered handler names, which is what we need.

### 2. Fix for ToolRegistry access

Changed from:
```python
# Get registered tools and their descriptions
tools = tool_registry.get_all_tools()
```

To:
```python
# Get registered tools and their descriptions
tools = tool_registry.tools
```

The `ToolRegistry` class stores its tools in a public attribute `tools`, which is a dictionary mapping tool names to tool functions.

### 3. Added Debug Logging

Added more detailed logging to help with troubleshooting:

```python
if DEBUG:
    logger.info(f"Available tools: {result['available_tools']}")
    logger.info(f"Available handlers: {result['available_handlers']}")
```

## Impact

These fixes allow the `get_available_capabilities` tool to function correctly, which is essential for the Chat Planner workflow. When this tool works properly, the Chat Planner can:

1. Discover what tools are available for use in the system
2. Understand what capabilities those tools provide
3. Generate plans that utilize the appropriate tools for different tasks
4. Properly execute those plans

Without this tool working correctly, the Chat Planner was failing to generate and execute plans, resulting in the fallback report being generated instead of the actual research report.

## Testing

The fix was tested by running the `economic_impact_researcher.py` script and verifying that:

1. The `get_available_capabilities` tool is properly registered and can be executed
2. The correct list of available tools and handlers is returned
3. The Chat Planner can access and use this information to generate a valid plan
