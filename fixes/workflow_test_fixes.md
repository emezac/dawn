# Workflow Test Fixes

## Issue with run_workflow_tests.py

### Problem
The `run_workflow_tests.py` file was encountering a NameError due to scope issues with the exception variable:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/admin/code/newstart/dawn/examples/run_workflow_tests.py", line 72, in <module>
    sys.exit(run_tests()) 
  File "/Users/admin/code/newstart/dawn/examples/run_workflow_tests.py", line 58, in run_tests
    print(f"Error importing test modules: {e}")
NameError: name 'e' is not defined
```

This occurred because the script was defining two separate `run_tests()` functions - one inside the try block and one inside the except block. The variable `e` from the except clause wasn't accessible in the inner function defined in the except block.

### Solution
The fix involved restructuring the code to:

1. Define a single `run_tests()` function outside of the try-except block
2. Move the try-except block inside this function 
3. Ensure that the exception variable was properly accessed within the same scope where it was defined

```python
# Define run_tests function outside the try block to avoid scope issues
def run_tests():
    try:
        # Import test modules and run tests
        from tests.workflows.examples.test_workflow_examples import TestWorkflowExamplesClass, TestTaskExamplesClass
        
        # Test execution code here...
        
    except ImportError as exception:
        # Handle import errors, using the exception variable in the same scope
        print(f"Error importing test modules: {exception}")
        # Error handling code...
        return 1
```

This fix ensures that the exception variable is properly accessible within the scope where it's used, preventing the NameError.

## Related Fixes

This fix complements the previous test fixes documented in `test_fix_documentation.md`, making the entire test suite functional. All workflow-related tests now pass successfully, including:

1. Task and workflow class tests
2. DirectHandlerTask tests
3. Registry and tool execution tests
4. Workflow example tests

These fixes ensure that the workflow recording and replaying feature works correctly and can be tested thoroughly.
