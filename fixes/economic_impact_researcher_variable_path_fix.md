# Economic Impact Researcher Variable Path Fix

## Problem Description

The workflow in `economic_impact_researcher.py` was failing due to several issues:

1. Field name mismatches between task definitions and handler functions
2. Incorrect handler function specified for the `execute_tasks` task
3. Parameter name mismatches in the execute task's input data

## Root Cause

There were several discrepancies in the workflow definition:

1. In `plan_to_tasks`, the handler function expected a field named `validated_plan_json` but the task was providing it as `validated_plan`.

2. The `execute_tasks` task was using the wrong handler function - it was referencing a non-existent `execute_tasks_handler` when it should have been using the `custom_execute_dynamic_tasks_handler` function that's defined in the file.

3. The `custom_execute_dynamic_tasks_handler` function expected a field named `tasks` but the task was providing it as `tasks_json`.

These mismatches would have caused the workflow to fail when trying to read the values from previous task outputs and when trying to execute the handler functions.

## Solution

We made the following changes to fix the issues:

1. In `plan_to_tasks` task:
   - Changed the input field name from `validated_plan` to `validated_plan_json` to match what the handler function expects.

2. In `execute_tasks` task:
   - Changed the handler function from `execute_tasks_handler` to `custom_execute_dynamic_tasks_handler`
   - Changed the input field name from `tasks_json` to `tasks` to match what the handler function expects.

## Verification

After making these changes, the workflow should be able to pass values correctly between tasks, allowing the entire process to execute successfully.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of ensuring that:

1. The field names in task input data match the parameter names expected by the handler functions
2. The handler functions referenced in tasks are actually defined and available
3. The data paths used to access previous task outputs are correct

A good practice is to maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the workflow definition and handler functions to avoid these kinds of mismatches. When defining handler functions, make sure to document clearly what input fields they expect, and when defining tasks, make sure to use the same field names.
