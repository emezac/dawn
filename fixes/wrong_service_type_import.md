# Wrong Service Type Import Fix

## Problem

The `economic_impact_researcher.py` script was failing with the following import error:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Services' from 'core.services'
```

The script was attempting to import a class named `Services` from the `core.services` module, but this class does not exist in the codebase. Instead, the correct class is named `ServicesContainer`.

## Root Cause

The error occurred because the script was using an outdated or incorrect class name (`Services`) that doesn't match the actual implementation in the codebase. The `core.services` module exports a class called `ServicesContainer`, which serves as the container for managing framework services.

This mismatch likely happened due to:
1. Refactoring of the services module without updating all dependent code
2. The script might have been created based on outdated documentation
3. Inconsistent naming conventions across the codebase

## Solution

The fix was straightforward - update the import statement to use the correct class name:

### Before:
```python
from core.services import Services
```

### After:
```python
from core.services import ServicesContainer as Services
```

Alternatively, we could update all references in the script to use `ServicesContainer` directly:

```python
from core.services import ServicesContainer

# Later in the code:
services = ServicesContainer.get_instance()
```

We chose the first approach (using an alias) to minimize changes to the rest of the code, making the fix more contained and reducing the risk of introducing new errors.

## Implementation

The fix was implemented in the `examples/economic_impact_researcher.py` file by updating the import statement on line 64.

## Results

After applying this fix:
1. The import error was resolved
2. The script could properly initialize the services container
3. The workflow could progress to the next steps of execution

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent naming**: Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase to prevent confusion.

2. **Alias use caution**: When using aliases in imports, ensure they don't hide the actual class names in a way that could confuse future developers.

3. **Import verification**: When developing new scripts or components, verify that all imports refer to existing classes and functions.

4. **Refactoring documentation**: When refactoring or renaming core components, maintain documentation of the changes and update all dependent code.

## Related Issues

This fix highlights a broader issue with maintaining API consistency across the codebase. Other scripts might have similar import issues if they were created based on outdated documentation or examples.

Consider:
- Conducting a codebase-wide search for other occurrences of incorrect imports
- Adding automated tests that verify the existence of imported components
- Creating a style guide that documents the proper import patterns for core components 

## Additional Fixes

### HandlerRegistry Attribute Access

After fixing the initial import issue, we discovered a secondary problem with the script. It was attempting to access a non-existent public attribute `handlers` on the `HandlerRegistry` object. The actual attribute in the implementation is named `_handlers` (with an underscore prefix).

#### Error Message:
```
AttributeError: 'HandlerRegistry' object has no attribute 'handlers'. Did you mean: '_handlers'?
```

#### Root Cause:
This issue arose from a misunderstanding of the class's internal structure. The `HandlerRegistry` class stores its handlers in a private attribute `_handlers`, but the script was trying to access it as if it were a public attribute.

#### Solution:
We modified the code to use the correct attribute name:

##### Before:
```python
logger.info(f"Registered handlers: {list(handler_registry.handlers.keys())}")
```

##### After:
```python
logger.info(f"Registered handlers: {list(handler_registry._handlers.keys())}")
```

This fix allowed the script to log the registered handlers correctly and continue with its execution.

#### Best Practice Consideration:
While this fix resolves the immediate issue, a better long-term solution would be to:

1. Add a public property or method to the `HandlerRegistry` class to access the handlers, such as `get_handlers()` or a `handlers` property.
2. Update the script to use this public interface rather than accessing the private attribute directly.

Accessing private attributes (those with an underscore prefix) directly is generally discouraged as it makes the code more susceptible to breaking changes in the future.

#### Improved Solution:
Upon further investigation, we discovered that the `HandlerRegistry` class already provides a public method `list_handlers()` that returns a list of all registered handler names. We updated the script to use this method instead:

##### Before (temporary fix):
```python
logger.info(f"Registered handlers: {list(handler_registry._handlers.keys())}")
```

##### After (improved solution):
```python
logger.info(f"Registered handlers: {handler_registry.list_handlers()}")
```

This approach follows best practices by using the public API of the `HandlerRegistry` class rather than accessing its private implementation details.
