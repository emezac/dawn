# Framework Compatibility with Wrapper Functions

## Problem

The Dawn framework undergoes regular API changes during development, which can break existing example code and integrations. Specifically:

1. Function signatures change in core modules
2. Class constructors are modified with new required parameters
3. Return types are altered to provide more structured data
4. Error handling approaches evolve

Using monkey patching to modify framework behavior leads to fragile code that breaks with framework updates and makes debugging difficult.

## Solution: Wrapper Functions Approach

Instead of directly patching framework components, we've implemented a wrapper functions approach that:

1. Provides a stable interface for client code
2. Adapts between old and new APIs
3. Handles error cases consistently
4. Makes debugging easier by isolating adaptation code

### Implementation

The pattern is demonstrated in `examples/simplified_compliance_workflow.py` where we use wrapper functions to create a stable abstraction over potentially changing framework APIs:

```python
def create_task(name: str, tool_name: str, 
                description: str = "", 
                dependencies: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> Task:
    """
    Create a task with the specified parameters.
    
    Args:
        name: Task name
        tool_name: Name of the tool to use
        description: Task description
        dependencies: List of task names this task depends on
        
    Returns:
        Task object
    """
    task = Task(
        name=name,
        tool_name=tool_name,
        description=description
    )
    
    # Handle dependencies if the framework version supports them
    if dependencies and hasattr(task, 'set_dependencies'):
        task.set_dependencies(dependencies)
        
    return task

def run_agent_with_input(agent, initial_input: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Run an agent with the provided input.
    
    Args:
        agent: The agent to run
        initial_input: Initial input to the agent
        
    Returns:
        Agent execution results
    """
    logging.info(f"Running agent with input: {initial_input}")
    return agent.run(initial_input)

def get_task_history(workflow_result: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Extract task history from workflow results.
    
    Args:
        workflow_result: Results from running the workflow
        
    Returns:
        List of task execution records
    """
    if "task_history" in workflow_result:
        return workflow_result["task_history"]
    elif "history" in workflow_result:
        return workflow_result["history"]
    else:
        return []
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Changes in the framework API require updates only to wrapper functions, not throughout the codebase
2. **Readability**: Code intent is clearer without complex monkey patching
3. **Testability**: Wrapper functions can be easily unit tested
4. **Documentation**: Wrapper functions serve as documentation for how to use the framework
5. **Forwards Compatibility**: Graceful handling of new features when they become available

## Best Practices

1. Keep wrapper functions focused on a single responsibility
2. Document the API you're expecting through function signatures and docstrings
3. Handle missing features gracefully by checking for attributes before using them
4. Return sensible defaults when expected data is not available
5. Log important information for debugging
6. Add type hints to make the expected interface clear
7. Place wrapper functions in a dedicated module for reuse across examples

## Future Improvements

1. Create a dedicated compatibility layer module
2. Add version checking to dynamically adapt to different framework versions
3. Develop automated tests for the compatibility layer
4. Add deprecation warnings when using compatibility features that will be removed

By following this approach, examples and integrations remain functional even as the framework evolves.
