# LLM API Method Fix

## Problem Description

The `economic_impact_researcher.py` script was failing with the following error:

```
Error in custom_plan_user_request_handler: 'LLMInterface' object has no attribute 'chat'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/admin/code/newstart/dawn/examples/economic_impact_researcher.py", line 305, in custom_plan_user_request_handler
    response = llm.chat([{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
AttributeError: 'LLMInterface' object has no attribute 'chat'
```

This error occurred in the `custom_plan_user_request_handler` function when it attempted to call a method named `chat` on the LLM interface, but this method doesn't exist in the current version of the `LLMInterface` class.

## Root Cause

The API of the Dawn framework's `LLMInterface` class has changed. The script was using an outdated method name `chat()` which is no longer available. The current version of the `LLMInterface` provides a `generate()` method instead.

## Solution

Updated the `custom_plan_user_request_handler` function to use the correct method for generating LLM responses:

```python
# Old code - using non-existent method
response = llm.chat([{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])

# New code - using the correct method
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
response = llm.generate(messages=messages)
```

This change adapts the code to use the current API of the `LLMInterface` class.

## Verification

After making this change, the handler function can successfully generate responses from the LLM interface.

## Additional Notes

API changes in the framework's classes are common as the framework evolves. When encountering errors related to missing methods, always check the current implementation of the class to understand the current API signature.

For the Dawn framework's `LLMInterface`:
- The old method was `chat([{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])`
- The new method is `generate(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])`

This change likely reflects an evolution in the framework to make the API more explicit and parameter names more meaningful.
