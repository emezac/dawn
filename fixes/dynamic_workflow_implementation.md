# Dynamic Workflow Implementation Fix

## Issue

When running the `economic_impact_researcher.py` script, we encountered the following error:

```
ERROR:__main__:Error in custom_execute_dynamic_tasks_handler: cannot import name 'DynamicWorkflow' from 'core.workflow' (/Users/admin/code/newstart/dawn/core/workflow.py)
```

The error indicated that the code was trying to use a `DynamicWorkflow` class that doesn't exist in the `core.workflow` module. This class was being used to create and execute dynamic tasks generated during runtime.

## Root Cause

The `custom_execute_dynamic_tasks_handler` function was attempting to use a non-existent `DynamicWorkflow` class, assuming it would have a constructor that accepts a list of task definitions:

```python
# This approach doesn't work
from core.workflow import DynamicWorkflow  # This class doesn't exist

dynamic_workflow = DynamicWorkflow(
    workflow_id="dynamic_research_workflow",
    name="Dynamic Research Workflow",
    tasks=dynamic_tasks  # Passing a list of task definitions
)
```

## Solution

The solution was to use the standard `Workflow` class instead and programmatically add tasks to it based on the dynamic task definitions:

1. **Create a standard Workflow**: Instantiate a `Workflow` object with a unique ID.
2. **Manually create and add tasks**: For each task definition, create a `DirectHandlerTask` with appropriate handlers and dependencies.
3. **Use Lambda functions for dynamic handlers**: Create task handlers based on the task type using lambda functions.

```python
# Create a standard workflow with a unique ID
from core.workflow import Workflow
from core.task import DirectHandlerTask
import time

workflow_id = f"dynamic_research_workflow_{int(time.time())}"
dynamic_workflow = Workflow(workflow_id=workflow_id, name="Dynamic Research Workflow")

# Add the dynamic tasks to the workflow
for task_def in dynamic_tasks:
    task_id = task_def.get("id")
    task_name = task_def.get("name", task_id)
    task_type = task_def.get("type")
    input_data = task_def.get("input_data", {})
    depends_on = task_def.get("depends_on", [])
    
    # Create handler based on task type
    if task_type == "search":
        handler = lambda data: services.tool_registry.execute_tool("web_search", data)
    elif task_type == "analyze":
        handler = lambda data: {"success": True, "result": f"Analysis of {len(data.get('search_results', []))} search results"}
    elif task_type == "report":
        handler = lambda data: {"success": True, "result": f"Report based on {data.get('analysis', '')}"}
    else:
        handler = lambda data: {"success": True, "result": data}
    
    # Create and add task
    dynamic_task = DirectHandlerTask(
        task_id=task_id,
        name=task_name,
        handler=handler,
        input_data=input_data,
        depends_on=depends_on
    )
    
    dynamic_workflow.add_task(dynamic_task)
```

## Implementation Details

Our implementation included these key components:

1. **Task Type to Handler Mapping**: We mapped different task types (search, analyze, report) to appropriate handlers.
2. **Unique Workflow ID**: Generated using timestamp to ensure uniqueness.
3. **Dependency Preservation**: We maintained the task dependencies from the original dynamic task definitions.
4. **Standard Task Output Format**: Ensured all handlers return data in the standardized format with `success`, `status`, and `result` fields.

## Best Practices

When implementing dynamic task generation:

1. **Use the Standard Workflow class**: The core Dawn framework uses the `Workflow` class for both static and dynamic workflows.
2. **Create Task Handlers on the Fly**: Use lambda functions or factory methods to create appropriate handlers for different task types.
3. **Maintain Task Dependencies**: Ensure that the `depends_on` relationships between tasks are preserved when creating tasks dynamically.
4. **Generate Unique IDs**: Task IDs should be unique within a workflow, especially when creating them dynamically.
5. **Consistent Error Handling**: Always return standardized output from handlers with proper error information.

## Potential Future Improvements

The Dawn framework could benefit from the following enhancements:

1. **Native DynamicWorkflow Class**: Implement a dedicated class for handling dynamic task generation more elegantly.
2. **Task Definition Schema**: Create a standard schema for task definitions that can be validated.
3. **Task Factory Methods**: Add factory methods to create tasks from different types of definitions.
4. **Registry for Task Types**: Create a registry mapping task types to handler implementations.

## Impact

This fix enables the `economic_impact_researcher.py` script to dynamically generate and execute tasks based on runtime information, making the workflow more flexible and adaptive. The approach maintains compatibility with the existing Dawn framework architecture while enabling more complex workflow patterns.
