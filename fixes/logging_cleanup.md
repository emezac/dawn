# Logging Cleanup

## Issue

Excessive debug logging was present in production code, particularly in the OpenAI vector store tools. While useful during development and troubleshooting, this verbose logging:

1. Creates excessive output that makes it harder to identify important messages
2. Potentially exposes sensitive information in logs
3. Decreases performance due to I/O operations
4. Makes code harder to read and maintain

## Changes Made

### Vector Store File Upload Tool

The `upload_file_to_vector_store.py` file contained numerous debug print statements that were removed while preserving the essential functionality:

1. Removed over 30 debug print statements
2. Consolidated error handling
3. Simplified code flow
4. Preserved the core functionality and error reporting

### Save Text to Vector Store Tool

The `save_text_to_vector_store.py` file also contained excessive debug logging:

1. Removed over 10 debug print statements
2. Simplified error handling by converting all exceptions to a single RuntimeError with clear message
3. Removed unnecessary file content validation that was adding debug output
4. Updated related tests to match new error handling patterns

### Test Updates

Test files were updated to match the new implementation:

1. Updated `test_upload_file_to_vector_store.py` to use HTTPX mocking instead of client mocking
2. Updated `test_save_text_to_vector_store.py` to test the correct error handling patterns
3. Added tests for empty file conditions
4. Removed references to batch IDs that are no longer returned
5. Added proper purpose parameter testing

### Benefits

1. **Cleaner Output**: Console output is now focused on essential information
2. **Better Security**: Reduced exposure of API responses and payloads
3. **Improved Readability**: Code is more concise and easier to maintain
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Error information is propagated through exceptions rather than logs

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. Use a proper logging framework (like Python's `logging` module) instead of print statements
2. Configure different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) for development vs. production
3. Create a centralized logging configuration
4. Add log statements only where they provide valuable information
5. Don't log sensitive data like API keys, tokens, or full API responses
