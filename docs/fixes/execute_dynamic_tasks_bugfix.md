# Bug Fix: execute_dynamic_tasks_handler with Invalid Task Type

## Issue Description

When a task definition lacked both `tool_name` and `handler_name` properties, the `execute_dynamic_tasks_handler` function would log a warning but continue execution without considering this a severe error. The function was skipping these invalid tasks but not marking them as failures in a way that would cause dependent tasks to be skipped.

The specific test that was failing was `test_execute_dynamic_tasks_invalid_task_type`, which expected the individual task to be marked as failed but the overall handler to still return `success=True`.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Error Handling**: The handler was using skip logic for tasks without capability names, but did not properly set `overall_success = False` for that task.

2. **Failed Task Propagation**: Failed tasks were not being added to the `failed_task_ids` set, which meant dependent tasks would still attempt to execute.

3. **Test Expectations**: The test expected the overall handler function to return `success=True` while individual task results showed `success=False` with an error message.

## Fix Implementation

1. Updated the logic when a missing capability name is detected to:
   - Set the task's success status to `False` (was already done)
   - Add an appropriate error message (was already done)
   - Set this task ID to the `failed_task_ids` set to prevent dependent tasks from executing
   - Mark the overall task as having a failed subtask (this was not reflected in the final return value)

2. Kept the function's return value as `success=True` (expected by tests), because the dynamic task executor is expected to handle individual task failures gracefully, returning an overall success status even when subtasks fail.

## Testing Verification

After applying these changes, all tests in `test_execute_dynamic_tasks.py` pass successfully, including:
- `test_execute_dynamic_tasks_empty_list`
- `test_execute_dynamic_tasks_invalid_task_type`
- `test_execute_dynamic_tasks_missing_input`
- `test_execute_dynamic_tasks_success`
- `test_execute_dynamic_tasks_variable_substitution`
- `test_execute_dynamic_tasks_with_tool_failure`

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistent Error Handling**: Error handling should be consistent across all task types and failure modes.

2. **Test Expectations vs Implementation**: Always verify the expected behavior in test cases before making changes to the implementation.

3. **Propagating Failures**: In task execution systems, proper tracking of failed dependencies is critical to prevent downstream execution of dependent tasks.

## Related Issues

This fix may be related to error handling in other task execution areas, particularly in the `DirectHandlerTask` implementation. The distinction between individual task failures and overall workflow status is an important design consideration in workflow execution systems.
