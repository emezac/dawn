# Machine Learning Optimization: Sprint 1 Plan (2 Weeks)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the initial infrastructure for collecting workflow execution data and train a basic machine learning model to predict the optimal next task based on the previous task's outcome.

## Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Design Data Collection Schema and Implementation
- **Define Data Points**: Identify the relevant data points to collect during workflow execution for each task:
  - Task ID and name
  - Task input data
  - Task output data
  - Task status (success, failure, retry)
  - Timestamp of task start and end
  - The ID of the task that preceded the current task
  - The ID of the task that was executed next
  - Any relevant performance metrics (e.g., execution time, LLM token usage if available)
- **Storage Mechanism**: Decide on a simple method to store this data. For the initial sprint, this could be:
  - Appending records to a JSON or CSV file
  - Using an in-memory data structure that is persisted at the end of a workflow run
  - A lightweight database (like SQLite)
- **Implement Data Collection Logic**: Modify your WMS execution engine (likely in your Agent.run() or WorkflowEngine) to automatically log these data points whenever a task completes. Ensure this logging mechanism is efficient and doesn't significantly impact workflow execution speed.
- **Consideration**: Think about how to uniquely identify workflow runs to group related task executions.

### Day 3-4: Generate Initial Training Data
- **Run Existing Workflows**: Execute a variety of your existing workflows (including those with conditional and parallel branches) multiple times with different inputs to generate a meaningful initial dataset.
- **Focus on Branching Points**: Pay particular attention to the data generated at points in your workflows where a decision is made about the next task based on a condition.
- **Manual Annotation** (Optional but Recommended): For this initial data, you might manually annotate some of the transitions as "good" or "bad" based on whether they led to successful workflow completion or quicker resolution. This can serve as a rudimentary form of labeling for your initial model.

### Day 5: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **Analyze Collected Data**: Review the generated data to understand its structure, identify any inconsistencies or missing values.
- **Feature Engineering (Basic)**: Determine which collected data points can serve as features for your ML model. For example:
  - The status of the previous task (categorical)
  - Potentially keywords or a summary of the output of the previous task (textual, might require basic NLP like tokenization)
  - The type of the previous task (LLM or tool)
- **Data Cleaning**: Implement basic data cleaning steps (e.g., handling missing values, converting data types).

## Phase 2: Simple Model Selection and Initial Training (Week 2)

### Day 6: Model Selection
- **Identify Task Type**: Frame the workflow optimization as a classification problem: given the state of the previous task (features), predict the "best" next task to execute.
- **Choose a Simple Model**: Select a basic classification algorithm suitable for a relatively small dataset and with interpretability in mind for this initial phase. Good candidates include:
  - Logistic Regression: Simple and can provide probabilities
  - Decision Tree: Easy to visualize and understand the decision rules
  - Naive Bayes: Works well with categorical and textual data (after appropriate encoding)
- **Rationale**: Avoid complex models like deep neural networks at this stage due to the limited initial data and the focus on establishing a basic pipeline.

### Day 7-8: Model Training and Evaluation
- **Prepare Training Data**: Format your collected and preprocessed data into a format suitable for your chosen ML library (e.g., scikit-learn in Python).
- **Train the Model**: Train the selected classification model using your generated dataset to predict the next task ID. If you performed manual annotation, use that as your target variable; otherwise, the actual next executed task will be your initial target.
- **Basic Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics for classification (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on a held-out portion of your training data. Focus on getting a baseline understanding of how well the model can predict the next task.

### Day 9: Integration with WMS (Initial)
- **Load Trained Model**: Implement the logic in your WMS to load the trained ML model.
- **Prediction Step**: At a designated point in your workflow execution (e.g., after a task completes), add a step where the model takes the relevant features from the completed task and predicts the ID of the next task.
- **Controlled Integration**: Initially, you might integrate this prediction in a non-disruptive way. For example, log the model's prediction alongside the actual next task being executed based on your existing logic. Alternatively, you could introduce a configuration option to enable/disable the ML-based prediction for specific workflow branches.

### Day 10: Documentation and Review
- **Document** the data collection process, the selected ML model, the training process, and the initial integration steps.
- **Review** the collected data and the model's initial predictions. Identify areas for improvement in the next sprint (e.g., more data, better features, different models).

## Expected Outcome of Sprint 1:
- A functional system for collecting data on workflow executions
- An initial dataset of workflow execution data
- A trained basic machine learning model capable of predicting the next task based on the previous task's outcome
- Initial integration of the model into the WMS, potentially in a logging or controlled prediction capacity
- Documentation of the work done and plans for the next sprint

*This first sprint focuses on building the necessary infrastructure and a basic model. The second sprint can then focus on refining the data, experimenting with more advanced models, and fully integrating the ML-based optimization into your workflow execution logic. Remember to keep the initial ML model simple and focus on creating a robust data collection and integration pipeline.*
