# AI-Powered Soccer Analysis Framework

Using an AI agent framework as a research and analysis tool can help gather information, process data, and identify potential value opportunities to inform betting decisions. This approach aims to augment analysis rather than provide perfect predictions.

## Objective
Analyze upcoming soccer matches to provide a summary of relevant factors and assess probabilities based on available data and odds.

## Workflow Tasks

### Task 1: Define Match & Parameters (Manual Input)
- **Input**: Match details (Teams, Competition, Date), specific analysis goals
- **Output**: Structured match parameters for subsequent tasks

### Task 2: Gather Recent Form & H2H (Web Search - Parallel)
- **Tool**: web_search
- **Input**: Queries like "Team A recent results", "Team B recent results", "Team A vs Team B head-to-head history"
- **Output**: Text summaries or links containing recent scores, performance metrics, H2H results
- **parallel=True**

### Task 3: Gather Injury & News (Web Search - Parallel)
- **Tool**: web_search
- **Input**: Queries like "Team A injury news", "Team B key player availability"
- **Output**: Text summaries about player fitness, suspensions, significant team news
- **parallel=True**

### Task 4: Gather Betting Odds (Web Search - Parallel)
- **Tool**: web_search
- **Input**: Query like "Team A vs Team B betting odds comparison"
- **Output**: Text listing current odds for various outcomes from one or more sources
- **parallel=True**

### Task 5: Analyze Uploaded Data (Optional - File Read/RAG - Parallel)
- **Tool**: file_read (requires pre-uploading relevant files)
- **Input**: vector_store_ids, query like "Analyze historical performance trends"
- **Output**: Insights extracted from the uploaded documents
- **parallel=True**

### Task 6: Process & Structure Data (LLM - Sequential after Parallel Block)
- **Input**: Results from Tasks 2, 3, 4, (and optionally 5)
- **Prompt**: "Extract and structure key information from the inputs..."
- **Output**: Structured data summarizing the findings
- **parallel=False**

### Task 7: Synthesize & Assess Probabilities (LLM - Sequential)
- **Input**: Structured data from Task 6
- **Prompt**: "Analyze the upcoming match based on provided data..."
- **Output**: Text analysis including likelihood assessment, reasoning, and potential value commentary
- **parallel=False**

### Task 8: Generate Report (Write Markdown - Sequential)
- **Tool**: write_markdown
- **Input**: file_path, content from Task 7
- **Output**: Path to the saved Markdown report
- **parallel=False**

## Benefits of the Framework

- **Automation**: Automates gathering diverse information
- **Parallelism**: Speeds up data gathering with concurrent searches
- **Structuring**: Uses LLMs to parse unstructured data into usable format
- **Synthesizing**: Leverages LLMs to combine data points into coherent analysis
- **Workflow Management**: Handles sequence and potential conditional logic

## Limitations & Considerations

- **No Guarantees**: Cannot predict outcomes with certainty
- **Data Quality**: Relies on quality and timeliness of gathered data
- **Odds Fluctuation**: Betting odds change dynamically
- **LLM Limitations**: LLMs can hallucinate, misinterpret data, or have biases
- **Statistical Depth**: Doesn't include complex statistical modeling unless specifically built
- **Responsible Gambling**: AI analysis doesn't remove risk - never bet more than you can afford to lose

This framework builds a powerful research assistant for soccer games but fundamentally cannot deliver "perfect bets."
