# Think & Analyze Enhancements – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Problem Definition

Modern AI agent frameworks excel at executing tasks but often **struggle with self-guided reasoning and error correction**. In our current system, the agent can leverage long-term memory, but it **lacks robust planning and reflection mechanisms**. This means the agent may tackle complex goals in a linear or trial-and-error fashion without **breaking problems into sub-tasks or learning from mistakes**. For example, if the agent encounters an error (like an API call failure or a code exception), it might not analyze the root cause or adjust its strategy effectively. This can lead to repeated failures or suboptimal fixes that address symptoms rather than underlying issues. In summary, without “Think” and “Analyze” capabilities, the agent’s autonomy and reliability are limited:

- **No strategic planning:** The agent does not systematically **plan out multi-step tasks** upfront, risking confusion or omissions in complex workflows.
- **Lack of self-reflection:** The agent does not **evaluate its own outputs or errors**, so mistakes often go uncorrected or require human intervention.
- **Inefficient error handling:** Failures in one step can cascade through the workflow if the agent doesn’t analyze and revise its approach ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Complexity%20of%20Multi)). Currently, error handling is rudimentary (halt or retry the same action) rather than intelligently revising the plan.
- **Missed learning opportunities:** The agent doesn’t leverage past experiences (aside from long-term memory recall) to improve future decisions. There is no mechanism to **learn from previous failures** and avoid repeating them on subsequent attempts.

These gaps result in an agent that may get stuck on challenges a human could navigate by thinking things through or debugging. The absence of reflection and planning makes the system **less resilient to unexpected problems**, reducing user trust in fully autonomous operation. To solve harder, **multi-step tasks reliably**, the agent needs internal “thinking” tools to plan actions and “analysis” tools to reflect on outcomes and errors.

## Goals and Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Enhance the AI agent with **reflection and planning capabilities** – enabling it to “think” through complex tasks and “analyze” its results – thereby improving task success rates, efficiency, and autonomy. The solution should integrate seamlessly with the existing Python-based framework and long-term memory module.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Autonomous Task Planning:** The agent should be able to **decompose complex instructions into a sequence of smaller tasks** automatically. By formulating a clear plan (or workflow) before acting, the agent can handle multifaceted goals step by step, similar to how a human plans a project.
- **Self-Reflection & Error Analysis:** After or during task execution, the agent will **evaluate its output and actions to identify mistakes or suboptimal results**. It should pinpoint the specific point of failure and the likely cause ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=,or%20column%20names%20were%20incorrect)). For example, if a database query fails, the agent should reflect whether it might have used the wrong table name ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=,or%20column%20names%20were%20incorrect)).
- **Dynamic Plan Adjustment:** The agent should not be stuck with an initial plan. It must be capable of **re-planning or adjusting its approach in response to errors or new information** ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Replanning)). If a step in the plan fails (e.g., an API call returns an error), the agent will modify that step or insert a fix (like adding a missing parameter) and **retry intelligently** ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Replanning)).
- **Increased Success Rate & Resilience:** By thinking ahead and learning from errors, the agent should solve tasks with **fewer failures and less human guidance**. We aim to reduce scenarios where the agent stalls or provides incorrect results. In essence, the agent should become more **accurate and resilient to failure** ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Improved%20Accuracy)), recovering gracefully from unexpected issues.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Thoughtful planning and early error detection should make the agent more **efficient in resource use and time**. By catching mistakes early, the agent avoids wasting cycles on flawed approaches ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Better%20Resource%20Efficiency)). We also want to minimize unnecessary LLM calls – **reflection should be used judiciously** so it improves outcomes without incurring excessive latency ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Latency%20and%20Cost)).
- **Seamless Integration:** The new “Think” (planning) and “Analyze” (reflection) tools must integrate with our existing architecture (the **Dynamic Workflow Management System** in Dawn). They should leverage existing features like conditional workflows and error propagation, and complement the long-term memory store (e.g. storing reflections for future reference). The design must be compatible with Python and our open-source approach, so developers can easily extend or modify it.
- **Maintainability and Clarity:** Even as the agent gains complexity under the hood, its behavior should remain transparent and debuggable. We will include logging of plans and self-critiques to aid developers in understanding the agent’s decisions. The architecture should follow best practices for clarity (e.g., distinct modules for planning vs execution vs reflection) and allow toggling or tuning the reflection depth for different use cases.

By achieving these goals, we expect an agent that **plans, reasons, and learns** more like a human engineer or assistant. It will address the root causes of problems instead of patching symptoms ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=1.%20o1,complex%20and%20indirect%20upstream%20causes)), **learn from feedback loops** to avoid repeating errors ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=propose%20Reflexion%2C%20a%20novel%20framework,pass%401%20accuracy%20on)) ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20propose,failures%20in%20order%20to%20form)), and approach tasks methodically rather than haphazardly. This will unlock more complex and longer-running autonomous tasks in our system with confidence.

## Design Inspiration and Research Insights

To design effective “Think” and “Analyze” tools, we draw inspiration from **state-of-the-art AI agent research and industry frameworks**. Several key patterns and systems inform our approach:

- **ReAct (Reason + Act):** The ReAct framework interleaves reasoning steps with actions in an iterative loop ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=1,Acting)). Instead of one-shot answering, the agent **thinks (chains of thought) and then executes tools step-by-step**, using the result of each step to inform the next. This pattern showed that combining **planning and reflection with each action** leads to better outcomes ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Link%20to%20paper%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Farxiv)). For example, an agent might think “the search returned irrelevant results” and realize it should refine the query ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Thought%3A%20I%20need%20to%20find,be%20refined%20for%20better%20results)). We plan to incorporate a similar loop: the agent will generate a *Thought* (plan or analysis) before each action and adjust if needed after observing results ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=,Example)).
- **Reflexion:** Recent research by Shinn et al. introduced “Reflexion,” a framework where an agent **uses self-reflection to learn from failures across multiple trials** ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=propose%20Reflexion%2C%20a%20novel%20framework,pass%401%20accuracy%20on)) ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20propose,failures%20in%20order%20to%20form)). Instead of fine-tuning model weights, the agent **writes down feedback to itself in natural language** and stores it in memory ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=propose%20Reflexion%2C%20a%20novel%20framework,pass%401%20accuracy%20on)). These self-critiques are then provided as additional context in the next attempt, significantly improving performance over time ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=simulated,com%2Fnoahshinn024%2Freflexion)) ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20propose,failures%20in%20order%20to%20form)). Notably, Reflexion achieved a **91% success rate on a coding benchmark, surpassing GPT-4’s 80%** by iteratively analyzing and correcting its mistakes ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=simulated,com%2Fnoahshinn024%2Freflexion)). This demonstrates the power of having an agent formally evaluate its failures and adjust. We will emulate this by having our agent produce *verbal self-critique* after a failed attempt and storing that insight (e.g., “I attempted X, but it failed because Y. Next time, I should do Z instead.”).
- **Planning & Replanning (Plan-and-Execute):** Another pattern (sometimes called “Plan & Solve” or deliberative planning) is to **formulate a complete plan before execution, then adjust as needed**. The Planner/Executor architecture is used in systems like “HuggingGPT” and others ([AI Agent Workflow Design Patterns — An Overview | by Craig Li, Ph.D | Binome | Medium](https://medium.com/binome/ai-agent-workflow-design-patterns-an-overview-cf9e1f609696#:~:text=,tools%20to%20accomplish%20the%20task)). The planner breaks the user request into sub-tasks, and a *replanner* can update the plan after each step based on intermediate results ([AI Agent Workflow Design Patterns — An Overview | by Craig Li, Ph.D | Binome | Medium](https://medium.com/binome/ai-agent-workflow-design-patterns-an-overview-cf9e1f609696#:~:text=,tools%20to%20accomplish%20the%20task)) ([AI Agent Workflow Design Patterns — An Overview | by Craig Li, Ph.D | Binome | Medium](https://medium.com/binome/ai-agent-workflow-design-patterns-an-overview-cf9e1f609696#:~:text=The%20Planner%20is%20responsible%20for,tools%20to%20accomplish%20the%20task)). For example, if during execution a new obstacle is discovered (no data available, an API is missing), the plan is modified to account for it (akin to a human updating their to-do list mid-way). We take inspiration from this: our “Think” tool will create an initial multi-step plan (a sequence of Task objects), and an **adaptive mechanism will allow inserting or modifying tasks on the fly** if the situation changes. Planning first provides structure, while dynamic replanning adds flexibility.
- **Devil’s Advocate (Anticipatory Reflection):** Researchers at DeepMind and UPenn proposed a “Devil’s Advocate” approach where the agent **anticipates potential failures *before* executing each step** ([Devil's Advocate: Anticipatory Reflection for LLM Agents | PromptLayer](https://www.promptlayer.com/research-papers/devil-s-advocate-anticipatory-reflection-for-llm-agents#:~:text=anticipate%20potential%20pitfalls%20,Advocate%20agent%20outperformed%20existing%20methods)) ([Devil's Advocate: Anticipatory Reflection for LLM Agents | PromptLayer](https://www.promptlayer.com/research-papers/devil-s-advocate-anticipatory-reflection-for-llm-agents#:~:text=asking%20itself%2C%20,The%20researchers%20found%20that%20the)). The agent effectively asks itself “What could go wrong with this step, and do I have a contingency?” ([Devil's Advocate: Anticipatory Reflection for LLM Agents | PromptLayer](https://www.promptlayer.com/research-papers/devil-s-advocate-anticipatory-reflection-for-llm-agents#:~:text=break%20down%20a%20task%20into,tasks%20more%20efficiently%2C%20learning%20from)). In tests on a complex web task benchmark, this **significantly increased success rates and reduced plan revisions** by allowing the agent to handle many issues proactively ([Devil's Advocate: Anticipatory Reflection for LLM Agents | PromptLayer](https://www.promptlayer.com/research-papers/devil-s-advocate-anticipatory-reflection-for-llm-agents#:~:text=ensuring%20a%20smoother%20execution%20process,the%20sequential%20nature%20of%20the)). This concept will influence our design by encouraging a pre-execution check. Our agent, after planning a step, can briefly “imagine” common failure modes (e.g., “If this API call fails, what will I do?”) and potentially adjust its plan or have a fallback ready. This reduces trial-and-error and makes execution smoother ([Devil's Advocate: Anticipatory Reflection for LLM Agents | PromptLayer](https://www.promptlayer.com/research-papers/devil-s-advocate-anticipatory-reflection-for-llm-agents#:~:text=asking%20itself%2C%20,While%20this)). While we may not fully implement exhaustive hypotheticals for every step (to avoid excessive overhead), the general idea of **thinking ahead about pitfalls** is valuable for critical or high-risk actions.
- **Multi-Agent Critique (Role separation):** In frameworks like **CrewAI**, complex tasks are handled by a team of specialized agents (or agent roles) working together ([Top 7 Frameworks for Building AI Agents in 2025](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/07/ai-agent-frameworks/#:~:text=CrewAI%20is%20a%20framework%20for,diverse%20expertise%20and%20coordinated%20efforts)) ([Top 7 Frameworks for Building AI Agents in 2025](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/07/ai-agent-frameworks/#:~:text=Key%20Features%20of%20CrewAI)). In particular, CrewAI and similar systems often include a **“Critic” or “Evaluator” agent** whose sole job is to review the work of another agent and suggest improvements ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=role%3D,backstory)) ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=CriticAgent%20,requests%20revisions%2C%20activate%20the%20RegressionAgent)). For instance, one agent might generate a solution, and a CriticAgent reviews it and either approves or requests a revision ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=3.%20,finished%20its%20research%2C%20activate%20the)) ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=,the%20revision%2C%20activate%20the%20ReportAgent)). This resembles a human peer review process and is essentially an implementation of reflection via a separate agent. In CrewAI’s hierarchical manager example, after the main agent completes its task, a CriticAgent is activated to evaluate the result and either send it back for revision or pass it along as final ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=CriticAgent%20,requests%20revisions%2C%20activate%20the%20RegressionAgent)) ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=match%20at%20L165%20Based%20on,is%20the%20output%20of%20the)). We plan to incorporate this pattern in a single-agent context by giving our agent an *internal critic mode*. The agent will “switch hats” after completing an attempt: it will use the LLM to critique its own output as if it were a separate reviewer. This internal critique will determine if it should revise the solution or finalize it. (In future, we could also allow an actual second model or process to act as critic for even more robust evaluation ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=External%20Evaluation)), but initially the same LLM can perform the role by prompt instruction.)
- **Industry Examples (Devin AI):** Devin, a cutting-edge autonomous coding agent, exemplifies many of these principles in practice. It uses a **compound system of multiple inference models to plan, act, and evaluate** its steps ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20biggest%20challenges,act%2C%20evaluate%2C%20and%20use%20tools)). Notably, the developers report that with a more reasoning-oriented model, Devin became much better at **backtracking and analyzing errors**, finding root causes instead of just symptoms ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=1.%20o1,complex%20and%20indirect%20upstream%20causes)). An example shared: older versions failed to diagnose a library version issue, whereas the improved Devin was able to research an error message and deduce the real fix (downgrading a dependency) through reasoning ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=,attribute%20%27UNICODE_EMOJI)) ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=solution%20is%20to%20downgrade%20the,GitHub)). Devin also proactively helps users **by suggesting how to break down tasks if the prompt is too complex** ([Release Notes - Devin Docs](https://docs.devin.ai/release-notes/overview#:~:text=,down%20when%20they%E2%80%99re%20too%20complex)). These insights confirm that *planning and reflection lead to more reliable and intelligent agent behavior*. Our design strives for similar robustness: the agent should dig deeper into errors and adjust course like Devin does (e.g., when facing an `AttributeError`, consider external information and not just the immediate stacktrace) ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=package%2C%20the%20solution%20to%20the,GitHub)). We will also consider UI/UX aspects such as advising task breakdown if a single query is too broad (possibly an optional feature where the agent responds with “This request is complex; I will break it into parts”).

From these inspirations, a clear picture emerges: **the best AI agents think before acting, and they learn from what happens**. By combining a *planning phase*, an *action phase with tool use*, and a *reflection phase*, we can create a cycle of improvement. Academically, this is backed by significant performance gains (higher success on benchmarks ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=simulated,com%2Fnoahshinn024%2Freflexion)) ([Devil's Advocate: Anticipatory Reflection for LLM Agents | PromptLayer](https://www.promptlayer.com/research-papers/devil-s-advocate-anticipatory-reflection-for-llm-agents#:~:text=ensuring%20a%20smoother%20execution%20process,the%20sequential%20nature%20of%20the)) and even surpassing stronger models by using these techniques ([Agentic Workflow : Four Core Mechanisms and Practical crewAI Code Analysis | by Joyce Birkins | Medium](https://medium.com/@joycebirkins/agentic-workflow-four-core-mechanisms-and-practical-crewai-code-analysis-d3bae0b78f0e#:~:text=The%20zero,4))). For instance, researchers found a smaller GPT-3.5 model with an agentic workflow (tools, planning, multi-agent reflection) actually outperformed GPT-4 zero-shot on a code task ([Agentic Workflow : Four Core Mechanisms and Practical crewAI Code Analysis | by Joyce Birkins | Medium](https://medium.com/@joycebirkins/agentic-workflow-four-core-mechanisms-and-practical-crewai-code-analysis-d3bae0b78f0e#:~:text=The%20zero,4)). This emphasizes that our investment in “Think” and “Analyze” tools can yield outsized returns in capability without necessitating a more powerful base model.

In summary, the design draws on **proven patterns**: the agent will employ **structured planning (breaking down tasks), iterative reasoning (reflect after each step), error feedback loops (learn from mistakes), and possibly role-based thinking (planner vs critic roles)**. These ideas from both academia (Reflexion, ReAct, etc.) and industry (Devin, CrewAI) will guide the features described next.

## User Stories

To ground the requirements in real-world usage, here are some **user stories** highlighting how the enhanced agent should behave. Each story is written from the perspective of either a developer using the framework or an end-user relying on the agent:

- **User Story 1: Complex Task Planning** – *As a developer*, I want the agent to automatically **plan a sequence of actions** for complex user requests, so that even if a query involves multiple steps (e.g., “research a topic, then write a report and email it”), the agent will **handle it methodically**. For example, when given the query *“Plan a budget-friendly two-week trip to Europe”*, the agent should internally break this into steps like **finding flight options, suggesting itineraries, and estimating costs** instead of trying to answer in one go.
- **User Story 2: Dynamic Problem Solving** – *As an end-user*, I want the AI agent to **adapt and overcome issues** during execution. If something goes wrong – such as an API returning an error or a needed resource not found – the agent should **diagnose the issue and try an alternative solution** *without* me having to intervene. For instance, if the agent is booking travel and a flight search API times out, I expect the agent to catch that and maybe try a different API or adjust the query parameters, rather than just giving up or returning an error message.
- **User Story 3: Self-Improvement** – *As a user*, when I give the agent a task that it fails to accomplish on the first try, I want it to **analyze what went wrong and attempt a fix by itself**, so I don’t need to explicitly direct every retry. If I ask the agent to write and run a piece of code and it hits a runtime error, it should **inspect the error, understand the cause, and correct the code** (for example, by importing a missing module or handling a corner case) in a follow-up attempt. I should then receive the corrected result without needing to ask specifically for the fix.
- **User Story 4: Transparency and Debugging** – *As a developer*, I want to be able to **trace the agent’s thought process** (plans and reflections) for debugging and trust. For any complex task, I’d like to see (in logs or in an interactive mode) what plan the agent formulated and any self-critiques it made after executing steps. For example, if the agent produces an incorrect final answer, I can check the reflection logs to see if it noticed any issues or if there was a flaw in its plan. This helps me refine prompts or adjust settings, and it gives confidence that the agent isn’t just a black box but follows a logical process.
- **User Story 5: Integration into Workflow** – *As a developer*, I want to easily **incorporate the planning and reflection steps into custom agent workflows**. I might have a specific sequence of tasks where I want the agent to pause and analyze before moving on. For example, in a workflow that involves generating a SQL query and then executing it, I’d like to insert a step where the agent **validates or critiques the generated SQL** (perhaps using an *Analyze* tool) before actually running it. The framework should make it straightforward to add such a reflection step, either through a parameter or by adding a special task type, without requiring a lot of boilerplate.
- **User Story 6: Configurability** – *As an AI engineer*, I want to **configure the depth and style of reflection** the agent uses. In some simple tasks, reflection might not be needed and just adds latency, so I want the ability to turn it off or limit it (the agent just acts directly). In very critical tasks, I might want the agent to reflect more or even have multiple rounds of reflection. For example, I might set a flag `reflection_level=2` meaning the agent will critique and even do a second self-check after revision. The system should allow these settings so I can balance **accuracy vs. speed** depending on the use case.

These user stories illustrate a vision of an agent that is **thoughtful, resilient, and transparent**. From automatic planning of tasks to self-correction and configurable behavior, the enhancements aim to make the agent more **autonomous and user-friendly** in complex scenarios.

## Feature Specifications

Based on the goals and user stories, we outline the specific features and requirements for the “Think” and “Analyze” enhancements:

### 1. Automatic Task Planning (“Think” Tool)

**Description:** The agent will include a **planning module** that takes a high-level goal (user prompt) and **produces a structured plan** – essentially a list of sub-tasks or an ordered workflow. This “Think” tool acts as the agent’s internal planner, allowing it to *think ahead* before acting.

- The planner should output a sequence of steps (a plan) that together achieve the user’s goal. Each step can be a description of an action or a smaller task (for example: *Step 1: Search for relevant information*, *Step 2: Analyze the information*, *Step 3: Draft a summary*).
- The planning can be implemented via an LLM prompt (few-shot prompt asking “Given this goal, outline a plan in steps”) or through a deterministic template for simpler tasks. We will likely implement a **`PlanTask`** that uses the LLM to generate a plan.
- The plan should consider available **tools** and capabilities of the agent. For instance, if part of the task requires external information, the plan should include a “web search” step. (We can give the planner module knowledge of what tools it can use, similar to how LangChain’s planning agents know the toolset.)
- The system must be able to take the plan and instantiate it as a **workflow** in our framework. This could mean programmatically creating a series of `Task` objects according to the plan sequence. The plan might be represented as a JSON or Python list of tasks that the `Agent` will then execute in order.
- **Plan Validation:** Optionally, we might include a validation step to ensure the plan is sound before execution. The agent (or a secondary check) can review the plan for feasibility (e.g., no obviously invalid steps). This could be a heuristic check (like ensuring required inputs are present) or even an LLM-based sanity check (“Critique this plan for any issues”). Initially, we can rely on the LLM itself to produce a coherent plan, and defer advanced validation to future work.
- **Replanning capability:** The agent should not treat the plan as static if conditions change. We will enable **dynamic replanning** – after each step, or when a step fails, the agent can update the remaining plan. This can be done by having a special “replanner” prompt that considers the goal, the original plan, and the progress so far ([AI Agent Workflow Design Patterns — An Overview | by Craig Li, Ph.D | Binome | Medium](https://medium.com/binome/ai-agent-workflow-design-patterns-an-overview-cf9e1f609696#:~:text=,tools%20to%20accomplish%20the%20task)). In practice, if a step fails or yields unexpected results, the agent could call the planner again (with context of partial completion) to adjust subsequent steps. This ties into the reflection feature below (since reflection will inform how to change the plan).

*Example:* If the user asks for a multi-faceted operation like “Gather today’s stock prices and send me a summary email,” the planning tool might produce: **Step 1:** Search for an API or website with today’s stock prices; **Step 2:** Fetch the prices for the relevant stocks; **Step 3:** Analyze the price changes; **Step 4:** Draft an email with the summary; **Step 5:** Send the email via SMTP. This plan would then be converted into actual tasks using our existing tools (WebSearchTask, DataFetchTask, AnalysisTask, EmailTask, etc.). The agent would follow this plan, step by step.

- **Success Criteria:** The agent creates plans that are logical and achieve the goal if executed. The plan should use available tools appropriately (no steps that our system can’t perform). In testing, we should see complex queries being broken down in a way that **human reviewers find reasonable and thorough**. We’ll measure this qualitatively and by success rates on complex tasks (before vs. after having planning).

### 2. Reflection and Error Analysis Module (“Analyze” Tool)

**Description:** A core new feature is the agent’s ability to **reflect on outcomes, especially errors, and analyze them to improve performance**. The “Analyze” tool will be invoked when certain conditions are met – typically after a task is executed, particularly if the result indicates failure or uncertainty. This module corresponds to the agent *thinking about what just happened* and deciding how to adjust.

- The reflection module will receive as input the context of what the agent just did (the action and its outcome). For example, it might get: “Tried to run code X, got error Y” or “Executed Step 3, result seems incorrect because...”.
- We will implement this as either a distinct task type, e.g., **`ReflectionTask`**, or as an internal call in the agent loop where after each action, the agent triggers a self-analysis via the LLM. The prompt might be something like: *“Analyze the above result. Did the step succeed? If not, why? What should be done next?”*.
- **Error Identification:** The reflection tool should first determine **whether there was a failure or problem**. This can be based on exceptions thrown by tools or checks. Our framework already supports error propagation between tasks ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=Error%20Propagation%20Between%20Tasks)) ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=The%20framework%20now%20supports%20robust,error%20handling%20and%20recovery%20strategies)). We can hook into that: when a task fails or returns an error, instead of simply bubbling it up, it triggers the ReflectionTask. The reflection prompt might include the error message and relevant logs.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** The reflection output should identify the **likely root cause** of the failure ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=1.%20o1,complex%20and%20indirect%20upstream%20causes)). For instance, if a web search came back empty, reflection might deduce “the query was too vague” ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=%2A%20Self,generic%20and%20revises%20the%20query)). If code failed with an exception, reflection might say “the function `X` is not defined, perhaps we forgot to import a library.” The agent effectively asks itself “Why did this happen?” and tries to answer in a useful way.
- **Strategy Suggestion:** Beyond diagnosing, the reflection should suggest a **corrective action or improvement** ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=,generic%20and%20revises%20the%20query)). This could be a fix to apply, or a modification of the plan. For example, *“The API call failed due to missing parameter, I should include that parameter and retry”* ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Replanning)), or *“No data was found because the search term was generic, refine the search and try again”* ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=,generic%20and%20revises%20the%20query)). The reflection might even suggest using a different tool (e.g., “I couldn’t solve this via web search, maybe I should use the calculation tool instead”).
- **Self-Critique on Success:** Reflection isn’t only for errors. We may also allow the agent to reflect on successful outcomes to see if they can be improved. For example, after getting a correct answer, a brief self-check might reveal “the solution works but is not optimal in terms of efficiency.” However, to keep things efficient, we’ll likely focus reflection on failure cases or when confidence is low. We can introduce a threshold or condition for reflection (e.g., after completion of the entire plan if time allows, or intermediate reflections only on errors).
- **Internal vs External Evaluation:** In some cases, we might want an external check. For instance, after generating code, running tests could be an external evaluator (outside the LLM) which then feeds results to the reflection. Our design allows plugging in **external evaluation tools** (like running a unit test suite, or a secondary model acting as a judge) ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=External%20Evaluation)). Initially, we will use the LLM itself to perform evaluation by inspecting outputs, but we leave room for integrating external evaluators in the future (the framework’s observability and testing features can help here).
- **Memory Integration:** The insights from reflection should be stored as part of the agent’s memory or state when appropriate. We already have a long-term memory (vector store); the agent can store noteworthy reflections (especially if a failure was resolved) into this memory for future recall. This means if the agent encounters a similar situation later (even in a different session), it could retrieve past reflections. For example, if previously the agent learned “for emoji library errors, installing `emoji==1.6.3` fixes it” ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=In%20the%20face%20of%20this,GitHub)) ([Cognition | A review of OpenAI’s o1 and how we evaluate coding agents](https://cognition.ai/blog/evaluating-coding-agents#:~:text=solution%20is%20to%20downgrade%20the,GitHub)), this could be recalled next time a similar error arises. Storing reflections also helps with the **continuous learning loop** ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Continuous%20Learning)) – over time the agent builds a knowledge base of what works and what doesn’t.
- **Selective Invocation:** We will implement controls so that reflection can be toggled or limited. For debugging mode, one might turn reflection on for every step to see granular analysis. In production, perhaps only on errors or final answer check to save tokens. This addresses the performance concern of added latency ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Latency%20and%20Cost)). Our framework could expose a parameter like `reflect_on=["error", "final"]` to specify when to run the Analyze tool.
- **Output Utilization:** The result of the reflection analysis will directly inform the agent’s next actions. If reflection suggests a fix, the agent’s workflow will incorporate that: e.g., generate a new task to implement the fix or modify the current task’s parameters and retry. We need a mechanism to feed the reflection output back into the planning/execution loop. This could be as simple as: after reflection, if a correction is suggested, either (a) directly apply it (e.g., adjust some state and re-run the failed task), or (b) modify the remaining plan (for instance, insert a new step like “Install emoji library version 1.6.3” before retrying the analysis step). The agent will then continue with the updated plan.
- The reflection text itself might not be exposed to end-users (unless in a verbose mode), but it will be logged for transparency. In some cases, we might surface a summary: for example, “I encountered an issue and have taken steps to resolve it by doing X.”

*Example:* Suppose the agent is asked to perform data analysis and plotting. It plans to load a dataset and generate a chart. During execution, at the “load dataset” step, it hits a file-not-found error. The reflection tool triggers, taking the error message “FileNotFound: data.csv not found”. The reflection (via LLM) analyzes: “The dataset file path is likely incorrect or the file is missing. Perhaps the file name is wrong or it wasn’t uploaded.” It suggests: “Check the file path or ensure the file is present. If the file name is wrong, correct it. If it’s missing, inform the user or choose a fallback dataset.” Based on this, the agent might adjust the plan: if a fallback is known, use it; if not, return an error to user with that analysis (a graceful failure). In another scenario, if reflection identifies a minor bug (e.g., an undefined variable in code the agent wrote), it would suggest the fix and the agent would apply it and rerun the code, all within the same session.

- **Success Criteria:** The reflection feature is successful if the agent is able to **recover from errors or improve output quality** without external intervention. Concretely, in tests, tasks that used to fail now succeed after one or two reflection-guided retries. We should see the agent identifying the correct reason for failures in most cases (as judged by developers) and taking appropriate action. Metrics could include: task completion rate improvement %, reduction in manual restarts, and qualitative correctness of reflection logs. We also expect to see that the agent avoids repeating the exact same mistake after a reflection – it should not get stuck in a loop of failing the same way.

### 3. Iterative Feedback Loop and Retry Mechanism

**Description:** This feature ties Planning and Reflection together into a cohesive loop. The agent will be capable of **iterating** on its plan until the goal is achieved or a certain limit is reached, embodying a trial-and-improvement workflow.

- After executing each step (or each significant step), the agent uses the Reflection module (if conditions call for it). If the reflection suggests changes, the agent will **revise the plan or step** and then continue execution. This creates a feedback loop: **Plan → Execute → Reflect → Update Plan → Execute...**, etc.
- We will implement a loop control in the `Agent` class. For example:
  1. The agent generates or receives a plan (list of tasks).
  2. For each task in the plan:
     - Execute the task.
     - If execution succeeds, proceed. If it fails or yields an unexpected result, invoke Reflection.
     - If Reflection provides a solution (like “do X and then continue”), the agent will either **insert a fix task** before continuing or **modify the current task and retry**.
     - Optionally, confirm the fix. Then continue to the next task.
  3. After all tasks, the agent can do a final Reflection on the overall outcome (especially if the final result might be improved).
  4. If at any point, the agent is stuck (reflection cannot find a solution, or a fix is attempted but the error persists after N tries), the agent should gracefully break out and return a failure with explanation. This prevents infinite loops. We might limit retries (e.g., no more than 2 automated retries per step without success).
- **Conditional Workflows:** Our framework’s support for conditional and parallel tasks ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=Features)) ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=,outcomes%2C%20enhancing%20flexibility%20and%20adaptability)) can be utilized here. We might design a conditional branch in workflows: if Task A fails, go to Task B (the analysis), then back to A (retry) or to an alternate path. The architecture could represent the loop as a conditional jump. In code, this could be simplified with a while-loop around task execution in the agent’s run logic.
- **Multi-round Reflection:** In some cases, one round of reflection might not solve the issue. Our design allows the agent to reflect, try a fix, and if that also fails, reflect again. Essentially, the loop can run multiple cycles (with a safe cap). This is similar to how Reflexion method does multiple “episodes” until success ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=propose%20Reflexion%2C%20a%20novel%20framework,pass%401%20accuracy%20on)) ([[2303.11366] Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2303.11366#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20propose,failures%20in%20order%20to%20form)). However, each iteration in our case is within a single agent session rather than completely starting over – meaning the agent retains context of prior attempts in the conversation state or memory.
- Logging each iteration’s outcome and reflection is critical for debugging. We will ensure that each cycle’s data (attempt, error, reflection text, fix applied) is recorded via the Observability component of the framework ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=,Observability)).
- **Performance Optimization:** This feedback loop can be costly if overused. Best practices to keep it efficient:
  - **Trigger only when needed:** Don’t reflect if a step executed perfectly and result is clearly good (we can determine this via either expected output validation or confidence analysis of LLM output).
  - **Shallow reflection:** If an error is trivial (like a minor formatting issue), a quick fix can be applied without a lengthy LLM analysis. Possibly have some known common errors handled by code (e.g., if a tool returns “Rate limit exceeded”, automatically wait and retry once, rather than ask LLM).
  - **Parallelizing where possible:** While reflection by nature is sequential (depends on the result of an action), note that our framework can run independent tasks in parallel. If there are branches of the plan that don’t depend on each other, they could execute concurrently to save time ([Release Notes - Devin Docs](https://docs.devin.ai/release-notes/overview#:~:text=,speed%2C%20especially%20for%20repetitive%20refactors)). The planning module should identify independent sub-tasks if any (though many tasks will be sequential). Also, Devin’s approach to do **multi-action in parallel (like searching multiple files at once) is noted** ([Release Notes - Devin Docs](https://docs.devin.ai/release-notes/overview#:~:text=,speed%2C%20especially%20for%20repetitive%20refactors)); we may incorporate similar ideas in the future to optimize execution time for batchable tasks.
  - **Model selection:** Possibly use smaller/faster LLM for reflection if appropriate. The reflection prompts might not require the full power of a large model, especially for straightforward error analysis. If we have access to different model endpoints, a faster model could handle routine reflections, and escalate to GPT-4 for very complex reasoning. This is a design consideration for performance.
- **Testing the loop:** We will craft scenarios to test iterative improvement. For instance, a coding challenge that the agent cannot solve in one go. We expect to see it fail, then reflect “I got this wrong because of X,” then adjust approach and succeed on the next try, all automatically. Another test might be a multi-step task where step 3 fails and requires an inserted step 3a to fix something, then proceed to step 4. The agent should complete the task with the inserted fix.

This feedback loop essentially **closes the gap between planning and execution by adding a learning phase in the middle**. It ensures the agent is not brittle – it can recover and course-correct. The result is akin to a self-debugging system: just as a human might try, see error, think, and try differently, our agent will do the same in an automated fashion.

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Transparency

*(While not directly a “planning or reflection” tool, this feature is a necessary complement to make the system usable and trustworthy.)*

**Description:** Provide detailed but organized logging of the agent’s plan and reflections for developers or power-users to inspect.

- Whenever the agent generates a plan or a self-reflection, the content will be logged via the existing observability hooks ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=,Observability)). We might log at `DEBUG` level to not overwhelm normal logs. Key information to log:
  - The **initial plan** the agent came up with (“Plan: Step1..., Step2..., etc.”).
  - Any **revised plans** or inserted tasks during execution (“Revised Plan: added Step X based on reflection”).
  - Each **reflection output** text.
  - The decisions made from reflection (e.g., “Reflection suggested retry with parameter A=5; agent will do that next”).
- If feasible, provide an **optional visualization** of the final workflow that was executed, including loops. Our framework already supports Graphviz visualization of workflows ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=Visualization%20of%20Workflow%20Execution)). We can extend this to mark which steps were re-tried or altered. For instance, if a task failed and was retried, maybe color it differently or show a node for the reflection. This can be useful for understanding complex flows post-mortem.
- In user-facing scenarios, we won’t normally show the raw chain-of-thought, but we may surface a summary of it for transparency. For example, the agent’s final answer to the user could include a note if it had to do some problem-solving: “(I encountered an issue with X but resolved it by doing Y.)”. Such summaries increase user trust that the agent handled issues properly. This can be optional or environment-specific (maybe more appropriate in a dev environment than a final production answer).
- The system should ensure that logs of internal thoughts do not accidentally leak to the user unless intended. This means our prompts should clearly separate the agent’s reflection from user-facing output. (For instance, when the LLM is asked to produce a reflection, that should not be sent back as the final answer. We manage this by using separate prompt instructions or function-calling capabilities if available to capture the reflection.)
- **User Control:** A developer using Dawn can enable “verbose mode” or similar to turn on viewing the thought process. In a REPL or notebook environment, one could see the agent reasoning step by step, which is invaluable for debugging complex tasks or improving prompt templates.

Success for this feature is somewhat subjective but can be measured by developer feedback: the logs should make it easier to understand agent behavior. We should avoid the logs being too noisy or overwhelming – they should be structured (perhaps prefixed with markers like “[PLAN]”, “[REFLECTION]”) and accessible. This logging does not directly improve the agent’s intelligence, but it greatly aids in verifying that the planning and reflection are working as intended.

### 5. API and Interface Adjustments

To support the above features, we will likely extend our framework’s API. Key changes might include:

- New **Task Types**: Introduce `PlanningTask` and `ReflectionTask` classes (subclassing our base `Task`). These tasks encapsulate calls to the LLM for planning and analysis respectively. They integrate with the `Agent` execution loop seamlessly:
  - `PlanningTask(goal)`: calls LLM to return a structured plan. Could output a Python list or JSON of steps which the `Agent` will then translate to actual tasks.
  - `ReflectionTask(context)`: calls LLM to analyze the given context (which includes the last action and result) and returns an `AnalysisResult` object or structured info (e.g., `{issue: ..., recommendation: ...}`).
- **Agent Workflow Control**: Update the `Agent.run()` or `Agent.execute_workflow()` method to incorporate the loop logic. Possibly add parameters:
  - `plan=True/False` to toggle automatic planning if the user hasn’t supplied a full workflow.
  - `max_retries` to limit reflection-based retries per step.
  - `enable_reflection=True/False` to toggle use of the reflection tool globally.
  - `reflection_on=["error","completion"]` to specify when to reflect.
- If the user directly supplies a workflow, we need to decide how/if to integrate planning. Perhaps if a workflow is provided, we assume they already planned it, so we skip initial planning. But we still would do reflection on errors within it, unless they disable it. We should allow the developer to embed reflection tasks in their workflow manually as well.
- **Tool Interface**: We might add a special tool that essentially invokes the agent’s own reflection. For example, one could consider “Analyzer” as a tool in the tools list. However, since reflection often needs privileged info (like the agent’s chain-of-thought or internal state), it might not fit exactly as an external tool. Instead, it’s more of an internal utility. So likely we won’t expose it as a generic tool to the prompting interface, but keep it under the hood.
- **API Example Usage:**
    - If a developer wants to utilize automatic planning and reflection, they might simply do:
      ```python
      agent = Agent(tools=[...], enable_reflection=True)
      result = agent.run("Some complex goal")
      ```
      Under the hood, `agent.run` will call the planner to break down “Some complex goal” into steps, execute them with reflection on errors, and return the final result.
    - For finer control, a developer could assemble a workflow:
      ```python
      workflow = [
          Task(...),  # some initial task
          ReflectionTask(...),  # check the result
          Task(...),  # next step
          # etc.
      ]
      agent.execute_workflow(workflow)
      ```
      But more likely, they will rely on the built-in mechanism rather than manually inserting ReflectionTask every time.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure that existing usages of the framework (if any) still work. If `Agent.run` currently expects a workflow, we can make the planning optional or provide a new method like `Agent.plan_and_run(prompt)`. We will document new parameters and defaults.
- **Error Handling Changes:** Currently, error propagation is supported ([GitHub - emezac/dawn: Dynamic Agents Workflow Network](https://github.com/emezac/dawn#:~:text=Error%20Propagation%20Between%20Tasks)). We will refine this so that instead of propagating immediately, errors can be caught by reflection. Possibly implement a **try/except around task execution in Agent**, where except triggers reflection rather than stopping the whole workflow. If reflection cannot fix, then propagate the error as before (or return a failure state).
- **Memory**: Provide methods to save and query reflection logs in the long-term memory. E.g., `agent.memory.store_reflection(reflection_text, tags=["error","solution"])`. This way, the knowledge base grows. We might also integrate a **semantic search** in memory before reflection: check if a similar error was seen historically and what solution was used (this could be done via our vector store tools, essentially giving the LLM some “hints” from memory before it generates a new analysis).

By implementing these API-level features, we ensure developers can harness the new capabilities programmatically and configure them to their needs.

## Architecture & System Design

The enhanced system will follow an **architectural pattern of a cognitive loop** embedded in our existing workflow engine. Below is a description of the architecture and how components interact (with an abstract diagram in mind):

**Components:**
- **Agent (Controller)** – Orchestrates the process. It invokes the Planner, then iterates through tasks, calls tools, and triggers Reflection as needed. The Agent is essentially the “manager” of the workflow ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20CrewAI%20uses%20a%20supervisor,graph%20from%20the%20langgraph%20supervisor)).
- **Planner Module** – Could be implemented as a sub-component or simply as a call to the LLM with a planning prompt. It takes the user’s request and outputs a plan (list of steps).
- **Task Executor** – The part of the agent that executes each step. This uses our existing Task and Tool interfaces. Each task can be an LLM call, a tool use (like web search), or a code execution, etc., as per our framework.
- **Reflection Module** – A sub-component that handles invoking the LLM (or other evaluators) to analyze outcomes. It may use a dedicated prompt template to evaluate success criteria or errors.
- **Long-Term Memory** – The vector store and knowledge base where the agent can retrieve relevant past information. This is tapped into by the planner (to recall if similar tasks were done) or by reflection (to see if this error happened before).
- **Workflow/Loop Control** – The logic that ties everything together: looping over tasks, handling conditions, branching or modifying the plan.

**Flow:**
1. **Input:** User provides a goal (or high-level task). Alternatively, the user might also provide an initial plan or some constraints.
2. **Planning Phase:** The Agent invokes the Planner Module with the user goal. The LLM (with a prompt template that encourages stepwise planning ([AI Agent Workflow Design Patterns — An Overview | by Craig Li, Ph.D | Binome | Medium](https://medium.com/binome/ai-agent-workflow-design-patterns-an-overview-cf9e1f609696#:~:text=,tools%20to%20accomplish%20the%20task))) returns a structured plan. 
   - The plan is parsed into our internal representation (could be as simple as a list of (tool, task_description) tuples, or a full `Workflow` object since our framework has a Workflow class).
   - This plan is optionally reviewed or adjusted if obviously flawed (basic checks or memory lookup to avoid known pitfalls).
3. **Execution Phase (with Reflection loop):** The Agent begins executing the plan step by step:
   - For **each step**: the Task Executor calls the appropriate tool or LLM as defined by the step.
   - **Observe outcome**: If outcome is successful and produces expected data, proceed to next step. If the outcome indicates failure or need for decision:
     - **Trigger Reflection**: The Reflection Module is called with the context (the step, input, output or error). The LLM is prompted (e.g., “You are an analyzer. The goal was X. Step Y resulted in Z (error or result). Provide analysis and next step.”).
     - The Reflection Module returns an analysis which might include a diagnosis and a suggested next action.
     - **Incorporate Feedback**: The Agent decides how to use this feedback. Options:
       - Fix and Retry the same step: e.g., adjust parameters or correct an error and try again.
       - Skip or modify future steps: e.g., if reflection says step is impossible, maybe remove it or replace it with an alternative strategy.
       - Insert a new step: e.g., a prerequisite was missing (like “install dependency”), so add that as a new task before continuing.
       - Abort: If reflection determines the overall goal is not achievable or out of scope, the agent might abort early with a failure message (with explanation).
     - The plan (workflow) is updated accordingly. We then loop back to execution of the (revised) step or move to the next step as appropriate.
   - This loop continues until all planned steps are completed successfully, or we exhaust retries/fixes.
4. **Finalization:** Once all steps are done (or the process is halted), if the task succeeded, the agent composes the final result for the user. Optionally, a final Reflection can verify the final output’s quality (“Is this answer complete and correct?”). If minor issues are found, it could improve it (for example, polish the final report).
   - The agent stores any important learned info to Memory (e.g., “While solving this, I discovered X works better, store that for future”).
   - Logs are saved, and the outcome is returned to the user (or calling function).
5. **Monitoring & Performance:** Throughout, performance metrics can be collected – how many iterations, time taken, etc., which can be used to refine the approach (perhaps the agent can self-adjust if it notices it’s reflecting too many times, etc., though that’s an advanced behavior).

In essence, we are introducing two new “phases” around the existing execution: a pre-execution planning phase, and a post-action reflection phase, creating an **Execute-Reflect cycle** ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=,Example)) until the task is done. This resembles a *deliberative agent architecture* (sense-think-act) as opposed to a purely reactive one. 

The design also allows **multi-agent extension** in the future – for example, we could split the Planner and Critic into separate agent instances (like in CrewAI’s PlanAgent and CriticAgent ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=Agent)) ([CrewAI / Hierarchical Manager: Build Reflection Enabled Agentic | by TeeTracker | Mar, 2025 | Medium](https://teetracker.medium.com/crewai-hierarchical-manager-build-reflection-enabled-agentic-flow-8255c8c414ec#:~:text=%29%20critic_agent%20%3D%20Agent%28%20role%3D,backstory%3D.......))). However, initially we’ll implement them as roles or functions within the single agent process for simplicity.

**Best Practices Considered:**
- We will use **clear prompt templates** for both planning and reflection to ensure high-quality outputs. The reflection prompt will include instructions to be specific and constructive (avoiding generic advice) ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Reflection%20Quality)).
- We plan to use **intermediate reflection checkpoints** for long tasks ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Complexity%20of%20Multi)) – e.g., after a group of steps or at logical midpoints, not just on errors, to catch issues early.
- Reflection usage will be **selective to manage cost** ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=Latency%20and%20Cost)) – possibly configurable thresholds or triggers as described.
- The system is designed to be **extensible**. New tool integrations will automatically benefit from reflection (any tool error can feed into the same analysis mechanism). New patterns (like “Tree of Thoughts” or advanced search strategies) could be added on top of this foundation if needed, since we now have a loop that can accommodate them.

In summary, the architecture enhances the agent’s “brain” by adding a **Planning subsystem** and a **Self-critique subsystem** around the core execution engine. This should result in an agent that not only has long-term memory (which it already did) but also **deliberates and learns, much like a human problem-solver** – aligning with the state of the art in AI agent design ([Top 7 Frameworks for Building AI Agents in 2025](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/07/ai-agent-frameworks/#:~:text=By%20providing%20a%20graph,the%20foundation%20laid%20by%20LangChain)) ([AI Agents 101: Everything You Need to Know About Agents | by Sahin Ahmed, Data Scientist | Medium](https://medium.com/@sahin.samia/ai-agents-101-everything-you-need-to-know-about-agents-265fba8b9267#:~:text=,other%E2%80%99s%20actions%20to%20increase%20robustness)).

## Technical Considerations and Constraints

- **Performance Overhead:** Planning and reflection both consume tokens and time. We must monitor the impact on latency. For relatively simple tasks, the overhead might outweigh benefits. We will likely allow users to disable these features in such cases. We should also test with various model sizes.
- **Prompt Limits:** The agent’s context window could become full when including long reflections plus long-term memory plus the plan plus current step. We need to smartly manage prompt assembly – e.g., not include irrelevant memory, summarize long reflections if needed, etc. Our vector store can help retrieve only the most relevant prior knowledge.
- **Accuracy of LLM feedback:** The entire mechanism relies on the LLM’s ability to produce correct plans and correct analyses. LLMs might sometimes give *wrong* reasoning (e.g., incorrectly diagnosing an error). We should be prepared for that. Some mitigation: use high-quality models for these critical thinking tasks; verify critical suggestions (for example, if reflection says “do X”, and we can quickly check if X is valid before doing it, that adds safety). Over time, if we find patterns of reflective errors, we can add guardrails or rules.
- **Security and Safety:** The agent reflecting on errors is generally safe, but we should ensure it doesn’t do anything harmful on “fixing” steps. For instance, if a step fails due to a permission error, the solution shouldn’t be to try a dangerous command. We might need to filter or constrain what the agent can do in a fix. Using our existing tool permission settings and not giving the agent new tools during reflection that it didn’t have initially is important.
- **Edge Cases:** We should consider when a plan might be totally off (the agent misunderstood the goal and planned wrong steps). Reflection might catch some of it if it leads to failures, but it’s possible the agent executes a bad plan successfully but it doesn’t achieve the user’s real intent. Human feedback or better planning prompts might be needed to handle that. For now, we assume if the plan is wrong, it will become apparent in results and then reflection can possibly trigger a replan. Worst case, the user might have to clarify their request.

## API Design Suggestions

Below are some suggestions for the API and how developers might interact with the new features. (This is not final code, but illustrative of the interface changes.)

**Agent Class Enhancements:**

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, tools=[], memory=None, model=None, enable_planning=False, enable_reflection=False, max_retries=1):
        ...
        self.enable_planning = enable_planning
        self.enable_reflection = enable_reflection
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        ...
    def run(self, goal: str) -> str:
        """Execute the given goal end-to-end using planning and reflection if enabled."""
        if self.enable_planning:
            plan = self._plan(goal)
        else:
            plan = [Task(prompt=goal, tool=self.default_tool)]
        return self._execute_plan(plan)
    def _plan(self, goal: str) -> List[Task]:
        # Use PlanningTask or LLM to create plan
        plan_text = PlanningTask(goal).run()  # pseudo-call, returns text or structure
        plan = parse_plan_to_tasks(plan_text)
        log.debug(f"[PLAN] {plan_text}")
        return plan
    def _execute_plan(self, tasks: List[Task]) -> str:
        for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
            try:
                result = task.run()  # execute task (could involve tools or LLM)
                log.info(f"Task {i+1} result: {result}")
            except Exception as e:
                log.warning(f"Task {i+1} error: {e}")
                if self.enable_reflection:
                    analysis = ReflectionTask(task, error=e).run()  # analyze error
                    log.debug(f"[REFLECTION] {analysis}")
                    fix = analysis.suggested_fix
                    if fix:
                        # Apply fix: e.g., adjust task or insert new task
                        new_task = create_task_from_suggestion(fix)
                        log.info(f"Applying fix: {fix.description}")
                        # either re-run current task after fix or insert ahead in list
                        tasks.insert(i+1, new_task)
                        continue  # go to next iteration to execute the fix
                    else:
                        # No fix suggested, break or raise
                        return f"Failed: {analysis.explanation}"
                # If reflection disabled or no fix, propagate error
                return f"Error: {str(e)}"
        # If loop completes without returning, gather outputs
        final_output = aggregate_results(tasks)
        if self.enable_reflection:
            final_check = ReflectionTask(final_output, final=True).run()
            if final_check.suggestion:
                final_output = apply_final_suggestion(final_output, final_check.suggestion)
        return final_output
```

In this pseudocode:

- `enable_planning` and `enable_reflection` flags control whether we use the new features.
- `_plan` uses a `PlanningTask` (which internally calls the LLM with a planning prompt) to get a plan. We then parse that into our Task list.
- `_execute_plan` iterates through tasks. If a task raises an Exception (indicating failure), we enter the reflection path.
- `ReflectionTask(task, error=e).run()` calls the LLM to analyze the failure. The result might be an object with fields like `suggested_fix` and `explanation`. 
- If a fix is suggested, we create a new Task for it (the logic of `create_task_from_suggestion` could, for example, create a ShellTask to install a dependency, or modify the current Task’s parameters).
- We insert the fix task right after the failing task, so it will execute next, then ideally we’d retry the original task. (The above pseudo continues to next iteration which executes the fix; after fix, the loop will go to next index which might be either the original failed task retried or just continue — in a real implementation, we might need to adjust index to retry the failed one.)
- If no fix is possible, we break out with a failure message.
- After all tasks, if `enable_reflection` is True, we do a final reflection on the output (maybe asking “Is the final answer good?”). If it suggests an improvement (like formatting or adding a detail), apply it. Then return output.
- This is a simplistic control flow; actual implementation may be more complex to handle multiple retries and nested failures, but this conveys the idea.

**Task Classes:**

```python
class PlanningTask(Task):
    def __init__(self, goal: str):
        self.goal = goal
    def run(self) -> str:
        prompt = make_planning_prompt(self.goal)
        plan_text = call_llm(prompt)
        return plan_text

class ReflectionTask(Task):
    def __init__(self, context, error: Exception = None, final: bool = False):
        # context could be the Task or output to analyze
        self.context = context
        self.error = error
        self.final = final  # whether this is a final output check
    def run(self) -> ReflectionResult:
        if self.final:
            prompt = make_final_reflection_prompt(self.context)
        else:
            prompt = make_error_analysis_prompt(self.context, self.error)
        analysis = call_llm(prompt)
        return parse_reflection_result(analysis)
```

These tasks use prompt templates:
- `make_planning_prompt(goal)` might produce something like: *“You are a planning assistant. The user’s goal: <goal>. Break down the goal into a numbered list of steps to achieve it...”* and possibly include tools info.
- `make_error_analysis_prompt(context, error)` might produce: *“You are an expert analyst. The agent attempted: <describe task>. It resulted in error: <error message>. Analyze why this error occurred and suggest a fix or next step.”* It could also include the agent’s overall goal for more context.
- `make_final_reflection_prompt(output)` could be: *“You are a critic. We have the final answer: <output>. Evaluate if this answer fully addresses the goal correctly. If not, suggest improvements.”*

The `ReflectionResult` could be a simple dataclass with fields:
```python
class ReflectionResult:
    explanation: str  # e.g., "The error happened because X"
    suggested_fix: Optional[Fix]  # e.g., Fix(description="Install library Y", action=some Task or instruction)
    suggestion: Optional[str]  # for final outputs, maybe a suggested change.
```
(We might unify `suggested_fix` and `suggestion`, but conceptually one is for error fixes, one for final tweaks.)

**Memory usage:**
We might add in Agent:
```python
if memory and analysis:
    memory.add("reflection", analysis.explanation + " | fix: " + str(analysis.suggested_fix))
```
to store the reflection outcome for later search.

The API should also expose to the developer:
- A way to manually invoke a reflection if they want (maybe `agent.analyze(context)`).
- A way to retrieve the plan if needed (`agent.last_plan` property after run).

We will document these new methods and classes in the project’s README and ensure the design remains Pythonic and intuitive.

## Conclusion

This PRD outlines a comprehensive upgrade to our AI agent framework, focusing on **Planning ("Think") and Reflection ("Analyze") tools** to enable advanced reasoning and self-correction. By drawing on ideas from cutting-edge research and industry systems, we aim to build an agent that not only remembers (as it already does) but also **thinks ahead and learns from its own actions**. These improvements will make the agent more reliable for complex, real-world tasks and easier for developers to work with, marking a significant step towards a truly autonomous and intelligent assistant.

The next step is to implement these features according to the development plan in `TODO.md`, with careful attention to testing each aspect (planning, reflection, integration) to ensure they work together harmoniously within our existing codebase.
