# Product Requirements Document: Think & Analyze Component

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-12
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the "Think & Analyze" component within the Dawn AI Agent Framework. This component is a crucial part of a chat-driven workflow, responsible for taking a natural language user request, understanding the user's goal, and generating a structured, machine-executable plan to fulfill that request using the framework's available capabilities (tools and handlers).

## 2. Goals

*   **Goal Understanding:** Accurately interpret the user's intent expressed in natural language via a chat interface.
*   **Structured Planning:** Generate a detailed, step-by-step plan in a consistent, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON).
*   **Capability Mapping:** Identify and select appropriate tools or handlers from the framework's registries to accomplish each step in the plan.
*   **Input/Output Definition:** Define the necessary inputs for each plan step and specify the expected outputs.
*   **Dependency Management:** Determine the sequential dependencies between plan steps.
*   **Context Awareness:** Utilize available context (tool lists, handler lists, optional conversation history) to generate relevant and feasible plans.
*   **Robustness:** Handle ambiguity, errors, and invalid plan generation gracefully.

## 3. Use Cases

*   **UC-1: Simple Task Execution:** User asks, "Summarize the document at /path/to/doc.txt". The component plans a single step using the 'summarize_document' tool/handler.
*   **UC-2: Multi-Step Workflow:** User asks, "Read the latest sales report PDF, extract the total revenue, and email it to manager@example.com". The component plans multiple steps involving file reading, data extraction (potentially LLM-based), and an email tool/handler.
*   **UC-3: Ambiguous Request:** User asks, "Analyze the market trends." The component identifies ambiguity and triggers a clarification loop (if implemented) or makes reasonable assumptions based on available context to generate a plan (e.g., plan might involve web search for recent trends).
*   **UC-4: Request Requiring Unavailable Tool:** User asks, "Translate this document into Klingon." The component recognizes no translation tool exists for Klingon and generates a plan reflecting this limitation or an error state.
*   **UC-5: Complex Goal Decomposition:** User asks, "Plan a marketing campaign for our new product launch next quarter." The component breaks this down into multiple logical steps (e.g., define target audience, research channels, draft copy, schedule posts) using available tools/handlers.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Input

*   **FR-IN-1:** MUST accept the primary user request as a natural language text string.
*   **FR-IN-2:** MUST accept context information, including:
    *   A list of currently available tools from the `ToolRegistry` (name, description).
    *   A list of currently available handlers from the `HandlerRegistry` (name, description).
*   **FR-IN-3:** MAY accept optional context, such as:
    *   Recent conversation history.
    *   User profile information (if available).
    *   Current workflow state (if re-planning).

### 4.2 Processing / Planning Logic

*   **FR-PL-1:** MUST utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the user request and context.
*   **FR-PL-2:** MUST decompose the user's goal into a sequence of logical, executable steps.
*   **FR-PL-3:** For each step, MUST attempt to map it to the most appropriate existing tool or handler based on descriptions provided in the context.
*   **FR-PL-4:** For each step, MUST determine the necessary input data. Inputs can come from:
    *   The initial user request.
    *   The output of a preceding step in the plan.
    *   Constants or user-provided configuration.
*   **FR-PL-5:** MUST represent dependencies between steps explicitly (e.g., step 2 requires output from step 1).
*   **FR-PL-6:** MUST generate the plan in the predefined structured format (See 4.3 Output).
*   **FR-PL-7:** (Optional - See Suggested Features) SHOULD identify ambiguity in the user request and flag it or trigger a clarification mechanism.
*   **FR-PL-8:** (Optional - See Suggested Features) SHOULD perform basic validation on the generated plan (e.g., checking if selected tools/handlers exist in the provided context list).

### 4.3 Output

*   **FR-OUT-1:** MUST output the generated plan in a structured, machine-readable format (primary format: JSON).
*   **FR-OUT-2:** The plan structure MUST contain a list of steps. Each step MUST include at least:
    *   `step_id`: A unique identifier for the step within the plan.
    *   `description`: A natural language description of the step's purpose.
    *   `type`: Indication of whether the step requires a 'tool' or a 'handler'.
    *   `name`: The name of the required tool (from `ToolRegistry`) or handler (from `HandlerRegistry`).
    *   `inputs`: A dictionary mapping the required input parameters for the tool/handler to their sources (e.g., `{"user_query": "${initial_request.text}"}`, `{"document_content": "${step_1.output.content}"}`). Variable notation (`${...}`) should be used for dynamic inputs.
    *   `outputs`: (Optional) A description or identifier for the expected primary output of this step, used for dependency mapping.
    *   `depends_on`: A list of `step_id`s that must be completed before this step can start.
*   **FR-OUT-3:** MUST include overall status information (e.g., success/failure of planning, any warnings or errors).

### 4.4 Context Handling

*   **FR-CTX-1:** MUST utilize the provided lists of tools and handlers during the planning phase to select appropriate capabilities.
*   **FR-CTX-2:** MUST NOT hallucinate tools or handlers that were not provided in the context.

### 4.5 Error Handling

*   **FR-ERR-1:** MUST handle failures in the underlying LLM call gracefully.
*   **FR-ERR-2:** MUST handle cases where the LLM fails to generate a valid plan in the required structured format (e.g., invalid JSON, missing required fields). Implement parsing with robust error checking.
*   **FR-ERR-3:** MUST handle cases where no suitable tool or handler can be found for a required step.
*   **FR-ERR-4:** MUST provide informative error messages when planning fails.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-PERF-1:** The planning process should complete within an acceptable timeframe for a chat interaction (target: TBD seconds, dependent on LLM).
*   **NFR-REL-1:** The component must reliably produce a valid plan structure, even if the *content* of the plan reflects limitations (e.g., inability to fulfill the request). Retry mechanisms for LLM calls should be considered.
*   **NFR-MAINT-1:** The prompts used for the LLM planner should be configurable and easily updatable.
*   **NFR-MAINT-2:** The expected output plan schema should be clearly defined and potentially versioned.
*   **NFR-SEC-1:** Ensure sensitive information possibly present in the user request or context is handled appropriately when passed to the LLM (consider PII scrubbing or using compliant models if necessary).

## 6. Suggested Features / Future Considerations

*   **SF-VALID-1:** Implement post-generation plan validation (logical consistency, input availability checks).
*   **SF-CLARIFY-1:** Implement a clarification loop mechanism for ambiguous requests.
*   **SF-CONFIRM-1:** Add an optional user confirmation step before task generation.
*   **SF-REPLAN-1:** Allow for adaptive re-planning if a task fails during execution in the subsequent workflow stages.
*   **SF-COST-1:** Estimate plan cost/complexity.
*   **SF-SUGGEST-1:** Explore suggesting new simple handlers if a gap is identified.
*   **SF-PARALLEL-1:** Enhance the planner to identify steps that can be executed in parallel and reflect this in the plan structure.

## 7. Open Questions

*   **OQ-1:** What is the precise, finalized JSON schema for the plan output?
*   **OQ-2:** What is the exact mechanism and format for providing context (tool/handler lists) to the planner?
*   **OQ-3:** What is the target latency for the planning step?
*   **OQ-4:** How should the component behave if *multiple* tools/handlers could potentially fulfill a step? (e.g., choose first, choose cheapest, ask user?)
*   **OQ-5:** What level of detail is required in the `description` and `outputs` fields within each plan step?
