Okay, using your existing AI agent framework as the core execution engine for your SaaS on Heroku is a smart way to leverage the work you've already done. Here's a breakdown of how you can structure this initial phase:

Conceptual Architecture on Heroku:

Web Application (Web Dyno - Flask/Django/etc.):

Handles user interface (signup, login, dashboard).

Provides a way for users to define their MCPs (e.g., a name, description, and the core prompt or instructions defining what the MCP should do).

Stores MCP definitions (user ID, name, prompt, etc.) in the database (Heroku Postgres).

When a user requests to run an MCP, it does not run the workflow directly. Instead, it enqueues a job into a task queue (Heroku Redis).

Displays the status and results of MCP runs (polling the database).

Task Queue (Heroku Redis Add-on):

A simple message broker that holds jobs (e.g., "Run MCP with ID X for User Y"). Libraries like RQ (Redis Queue) or Dramatiq work well on Heroku.

Workflow Executor (Worker Dyno - Your Python Framework):

This is where your AI agent framework lives and runs.

A separate Python process runs on one or more worker dynos.

It listens to the task queue (Redis).

When it picks up a job ("Run MCP X"):

It fetches the MCP definition (especially the user's core prompt) from the database (Postgres).

Crucially: It uses the user's prompt as input to generate a Workflow object using your framework's Workflow and Task classes. This generation might initially be simple (e.g., a single LLM task using the prompt) or more complex (using an LLM to break down the user prompt into multiple tasks using available tools defined in your registry).

It instantiates your framework's Agent, loading the generated Workflow.

It uses your framework's ToolRegistry and LLMInterface.

It executes the workflow using agent.run() or agent.run_async().

It saves the final result (agent.get_results()) back into the database, updating the job status.

How Your Framework Fits In (Worker Dyno):




# Example structure for your worker script (e.g., worker.py)
# Needs to be run via your Procfile: worker: python worker.py

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from redis import Redis
from rq import Worker, Queue, Connection

# Import your framework components
from core.agent import Agent
from core.workflow import Workflow
from core.task import Task
from core.tools.registry import ToolRegistry # Your pre-configured registry
from core.llm.interface import LLMInterface # Your LLM interface

# Import database models (assuming you use an ORM like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM)
# from your_webapp.models import MCP, MCPRun, db_session etc.

load_dotenv()

# --- Setup ---
listen = ['high', 'default', 'low'] # RQ queues to listen on
redis_url = os.getenv('REDIS_URL', 'redis://localhost:6379') # Get from Heroku env vars
conn = Redis.from_url(redis_url)

# Initialize framework components ONCE per worker process if possible
# (or ensure they are lightweight enough to init per task)
tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
llm_interface = LLMInterface() # Assumes API key is via env var

# --- Task Function (The Job Executed by RQ) ---
def execute_mcp_workflow(mcp_id: int, user_id: int):
    """
    The function executed by the RQ worker for each job.
    """
    print(f"Worker processing job for MCP ID: {mcp_id}, User ID: {user_id}")
    # Fetch MCP definition from DB
    # mcp_definition = fetch_mcp_from_db(mcp_id, user_id) -> returns dict/object
    # if not mcp_definition:
    #     print(f"Error: MCP {mcp_id} not found for user {user_id}")
    #     return # Or update job status to failed

    try:
        # --- 1. Generate Workflow from MCP Definition ---
        # This is a placeholder - requires logic (potentially another LLM call)
        # to convert mcp_definition['prompt'] into your Workflow/Task objects.
        # Start simple: a workflow with ONE LLM task using the user's prompt.
        user_prompt = mcp_definition.get('prompt', 'Default prompt if missing')
        workflow = Workflow(workflow_id=f"mcp_{mcp_id}_run_{job_id}", name=mcp_definition.get('name', 'MCP Run')) # job_id might come from RQ
        task1 = Task(
            task_id="mcp_main_task",

            input_data={"prompt": user_prompt}
            # Add tool_name if MCP definition specifies a tool, etc.
            # More complex logic here generates multi-step workflows
        )
        workflow.add_task(task1)
        print(f"Generated simple workflow for MCP {mcp_id}")

        # --- 2. Instantiate Agent and Load Workflow ---
        # Use the pre-initialized components
        agent = Agent(
            agent_id=f"agent_for_mcp_{mcp_id}",
            name=f"Agent for {mcp_definition.get('name', 'MCP')}",
            llm_interface=llm_interface,
            tool_registry=tool_registry
        )
        agent.load_workflow(workflow)
        print(f"Agent created and workflow loaded for MCP {mcp_id}")

        # --- 3. Execute Workflow using your Framework ---
        # Use run() or run_async() based on the generated workflow's needs
        # If generated workflow has parallel tasks, use run_async()
        print(f"Executing workflow for MCP {mcp_id}...")
        results = agent.run_async() # Or agent.run()
        print(f"Workflow execution finished for MCP {mcp_id}. Status: {results.get('status')}")

        # --- 4. Save Results ---
        # save_mcp_results_to_db(mcp_id, user_id, job_id, results)
        print(f"Results saved for MCP {mcp_id}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"ERROR executing MCP {mcp_id}: {e}")
        # update_job_status_to_failed_in_db(job_id, str(e))
        # RQ might handle retry logic based on exceptions

# --- Start Worker ---
if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(conn):
        worker = Worker(map(Queue, listen))
        print(f"Worker started. Listening on queues: {listen}")
        worker.work()


Implementation Steps:

Web Framework Choice: Select Flask, Django, FastAPI, etc., for your web dyno.

Database Models: Define how you'll store Users and MCP definitions (name, description, user_prompt, potentially the generated workflow JSON/YAML).

Web UI: Create pages for signup/login, creating/listing MCPs, and viewing results.

MCP -> Workflow Generation Logic: This is key. How does a user's simple prompt ("Summarize the key points about AI ethics from the attached PDF and recent web news") turn into the multi-step Workflow your framework runs? Start simple (maybe just one LLM task) and iterate. You might use another instance of your framework or a direct LLM call for this translation step.

Task Queue Setup: Integrate RQ or Dramatiq. Create the enqueue logic in your web app views and the worker script (worker.py) with the execute_mcp_workflow task function.

Procfile: Define your web process (e.g., web: gunicorn app:app) and your worker process (e.g., worker: python worker.py).

Deployment: Deploy to Heroku, add Postgres and Redis add-ons, scale web/worker dynos as needed.

Prioritizing Functionality for Heroku:

Focus on API-based MCPs: Leverage your framework's ability to call external APIs (OpenAI, web search). These are less resource-intensive on Heroku dynos.

Delay Heavy RAG/Local Models: File processing (embedding) and running large local models are generally prohibitive on standard Heroku dynos. Plan to offload these to specialized services (like vector DB add-ons, or AWS/GCP functions triggered via the task queue) after validating the core SaaS concept.

Optimize process_task_input: Ensure your substitution logic is efficient, as it runs for every task.

Background Execution is Key: Do not run agent.run() or agent.run_async() inside your web request cycle. Use worker dynos.

By using your framework as the execution core within Heroku workers and building a web front-end to manage MCP definitions and trigger jobs, you can create a functional initial SaaS version effectively.
