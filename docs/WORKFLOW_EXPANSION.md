# 🧠 Workflow Expansion Recommendation

Considering your next tasks to enhance your **Workflow Management System (WMS)**—specifically adding support for **conditional** and **parallel** workflows—here is a structured recommendation in Markdown format.

---

## ✅ 1. Conditional Workflow (Recommended First Step)

**Why Conditional First?**

- **Ease of Implementation:** Extends naturally from existing sequential logic.
- **Immediate Value:** Adds adaptability based on task results or defined conditions.
- **Essential for Dynamic Behavior:** Critical to enabling decision-making (retry, skip, adjust, new task generation).

### 🔍 Key Implementation Details

- Conditional branches based on:
  - Task outcomes (`success`, `failure`, specific results).
  - Custom logical conditions.
- Clearly define conditional logic at the task level:
  ```yaml
  next_task_id_on_success: "task_id_success"
  next_task_id_on_failure: "task_id_failure"
  condition: "output_data meets certain criteria"
  ```

### 📝 Example Workflow (Conditional):

```python
workflow = [
    {
        "id": "task_1",
        "tool": "llm_generate_idea",
        "condition": None
    },
    {
        "id": "task_2a",
        "tool": "draft_email",
        "condition": {
            "depends_on": "task_1",
            "if_result": "good"
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "task_2b",
        "tool": "retry_generate_idea",
        "condition": {
            "depends_on": "task_1",
            "if_result": "bad"
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "task_3",
        "tool": "send_email",
        "condition": {
            "depends_on": ["task_2a", "task_2b"]
        }
    }
]
```

## ✅ 2. Parallel Workflow (Next Logical Expansion)

**Why Parallel Next?**

- **Increased Efficiency:** Execute independent tasks simultaneously.
- **Scalability:** Ideal when multiple tasks are independent and don’t affect each other’s execution directly.

### 🔍 Key Implementation Details

- Identify task independence clearly with a dependency graph.
- Leverage Python concurrency methods (`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` or `asyncio`) for parallelism.
- Maintain explicit synchronization for tasks dependent on parallel tasks' outcomes.

### 📝 Example Workflow (Parallel):

```python
workflow = [
    {
        "id": "task_1",
        "tool": "web_search",
        "dependencies": []
    },
    {
        "id": "task_2",
        "tool": "calculate",
        "dependencies": []
    },
    {
        "id": "task_3",
        "tool": "summarize_results",
        "dependencies": ["task_1", "task_2"]
    }
]
```

> **Note:**  
> *`task_1` and `task_2` run simultaneously due to no mutual dependencies. `task_3` runs only after both complete.*

## ⚙️ Implementation Strategy Summary

| Step | Description                                    | Priority  |
|------|------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1    | Implement Conditional Workflow logic           | 🟢 **High** |
| 2    | Test and document Conditional Workflows        | 🟢 **High** |
| 3    | Implement Parallel Workflow execution          | 🔵 Medium |
| 4    | Add comprehensive monitoring/logging           | 🟡 Medium |
| 5    | Optimize for concurrency and performance       | 🟠 Low    |

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

**Start by adding Conditional Workflow support**, ensuring immediate enhancements in flexibility and adaptability. Once this foundation is stable, implement Parallel Workflow execution to optimize performance and scalability.

This strategy will align effectively with your project's objectives for a robust, dynamic WMS.
