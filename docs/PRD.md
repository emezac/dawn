# Project Development Plan: AI Agent Framework with Dynamic Workflow Management

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to develop a new open-source Python framework for building Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. The main goal is to simplify the development of agent-based applications, inspired by recent initiatives like new OpenAI APIs and SDKs, with a key differentiator: a robust and explicit system for dynamic workflow management. This system will allow agents to break down complex tasks, execute sub-tasks, evaluate results (feedback), and dynamically adjust the action plan, improving agent reliability and adaptability.

## 2. Motivation and Problem to Solve

- **Current Complexity:** Despite rapid advancements, developing AI agents remains complex. Integrating LLMs, external tools, state management, and control logic requires significant effort.
- **Need for Simplification:** There is clear demand (evidenced by new API/SDK releases) for tools that abstract part of this complexity and offer a simpler development experience.
- **Limited Workflow Management:** Many basic frameworks lack sophisticated and explicit systems for managing complex workflows. Task decomposition, state tracking, and feedback-based adaptation are often implemented ad hoc, making reuse and robustness difficult.
- **Opportunity:** Implementing a structured and dynamic workflow management system, as described here, is a feasible improvement (initially without complex ML) that adds significant value by enabling agents to handle multi-step tasks with uncertainty.

## 3. Project Goals and Objectives

**Main Goal:** Create an intuitive and modular Python framework for building AI agents.

### Key Objectives

1. **Workflow Management System (WMS):**
   - Explicit task representation (state, dependencies, tools, expected results).
   - Definition of workflows (sequential, parallel, conditional).
   - Monitored task execution.
   - Feedback integration for decision-making (retry, skip, adjust, generate new tasks).
   - Workflow state tracking.
   - **Visualization of Workflow Execution:** Generate visual representations of workflows to aid in understanding and debugging.

2. **Simple Interface for LLMs:**
   - Compatibility with popular APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
   - Inspired by the simplicity of Chat Completions with tool support.

3. **Standard Mechanism for Tools:**
   - Easy integration of custom tools (e.g., web search, file access, code execution).

4. **Basic Observability Features:**
   - Logging and tracing to support debugging and workflow analysis.

5. **Initial Functional Version (v1.0):**
   - With clear documentation and usage examples.

## 4. Project Scope (Initial Version v1.0)

### Included

- Core Python framework (base classes for Agent, Task, Workflow).
- WMS implementation with described features.
- LLM interface (request/response pattern with function/tool calling).
- Mechanism to define and register custom tools.
- Basic tool examples (e.g., calculator, web search mock).
- Basic logging system for workflow tracing.
- **Visualization of Workflow Execution:** Using Graphviz to create visual representations of workflows.
- Fundamental documentation (installation, basic concepts, simple tutorial).
- Unit tests for core components.

### Excluded (Future Considerations)

- Complex multi-agent orchestration (beyond modular agent calls).
- ML-based workflow optimization.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI).
- Native Ruby support (may be considered post v1.0).
- Extensive library of prebuilt tools (focus is on the mechanism).
- Advanced state persistence or integrated vector databases (can be used externally).
- Full support for APIs like Assistants API (inspiration only, not replication).

## 5. Key Features in Detail

### Agent Core

- Base class encapsulating state, configuration, and main lifecycle.

### Workflow Management System (WMS)

- **Task Representation:** Classes or dicts for tasks with attributes like `id`, `name`, `status` (`pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `skipped`), `dependencies`, `tool_required`, `input_data`, `output_data`, `retry_count`, `max_retries`.
- **Workflow Definition:** Represented as a directed graph (initially using lists/dicts or a library like `networkx`).
- **Execution Engine:** Iterates over tasks, checks dependencies, manages state, executes via LLM or tool.
- **Feedback Handler:** Interprets task results and decides next actions (continue, retry, fail, activate condition).
- **State Tracking:** Maintains current state of tasks and overall workflow.
- **Visualization:** Generate visual representations of workflows using Graphviz to aid in understanding and debugging.

### LLM Interface

- Abstraction for sending prompts and receiving responses, handling function/tool calling logic.
- Configurable for different providers/models.

### Tool Interface

- Registry of tools with descriptions and executable functions in Python.
- **Example Tool: Calculate**
  - **Function Signature**: `calculate(operation: str, a: float, b: float) -> float`
  - **Description**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) on two numbers.
  - **Usage**: The tool is registered with the agent and can be called within a workflow to perform calculations.

### Web Search Tool

- **Purpose**: Allows models to search the web for the latest information before generating a response.
- **Integration**: Configured in the `tools` array of an API request. The model can choose to use the web search based on the input prompt.
- **Output**: Includes web search call details and message content with inline citations for URLs.
- **Customization**: Supports user location specification and search context size adjustments.

### Observability

- Logging hooks at key points (task start/end, state change, tool call, WMS decision) for detailed tracing.

### Parallel Workflows

- **Objective:** Implement parallel task execution to improve efficiency and reduce execution time for independent tasks.
- **Technical Approach:**
  - Use Python's `asyncio` for I/O-bound tasks or `threading`/`multiprocessing` for CPU-bound tasks.
  - Develop a task scheduler to manage and dispatch tasks concurrently.
  - Ensure task isolation and introduce synchronization points where necessary.
  - Implement real-time logging and status updates for task tracking.
  - Provide documentation and examples for defining and executing parallel workflows.

## 6. Technical Approach

- **Language:** Python 3.x (robust AI/ML ecosystem and community).
- **Design:** Object-oriented, modular, extensible. Clear separation of concerns (Agent, WMS, LLM Interface, Tool Interface).
- **Workflow Handling:**
  - Initially with native Python structures (lists, dicts, classes).
  - Explicit control logic (loops, conditionals) to manage state- and feedback-driven flow.
- **Dependencies:** Minimal for the core. APIs like `openai` and `requests` for specific use cases.
- **Testing:** `pytest` for unit and integration tests.

## 7. Development Phases and Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation and Core (Estimated 4–6 weeks)

- Add more observability/logging.
- **Visualization of Workflows:** Implement visualization using Graphviz.
- Write tests for WMS and tool integration.

**Milestone:** Agent executes workflow with conditionals, retries failed tasks, uses external tools, and adjusts plans based on intermediate results.

### Phase 3: Refinement, Documentation, and Release (Estimated 4–6 weeks)

- Refine framework APIs based on usage and testing.
- Write complete documentation: installation guide, key concepts, tutorials, advanced examples.
- Improve test coverage.
- Consider simple state persistence (optional).
- Package framework for easy installation (PyPI).

**Milestone:** Launch of version v1.0 as an open-source package.

## 8. Required Resources

- **Personnel:** 1–2 Python developers with software design and AI/LLM experience.
- **Infrastructure:** Standard dev environment, access to LLM APIs (token/credit budget), version control (e.g., GitHub).
- **Time:** Approximately 14–20 weeks for v1.0 (depending on availability).

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

- **Workflow Complexity:** Start with simple use cases, use modular design, iterate with feedback.
- **LLM API/Paradigm Changes:** Abstract LLM interfaces, stay updated, plan for periodic refactors.
- **Tool Interface Challenges:** Focus on simple, flexible registration/call mechanism; provide good examples.
